How many times have you heard a song which has been written for some football match or tournament and thought “I could do better than that” ?

Every time England qualify for the World Cup Finals, it’s a scramble to see who can release the most popular and banal ditty – usually penned, warbled or starring some lowly celebrity that is down on their luck and fancies a few quid from record sales. They’re always disappointing and one feels that they are just being used to cash in on other people’s success.

Of course, in The Good Old Days <sup>TM</sup> of the FA Cup (when every club in the land wanted to win the jug, or at least wanted to take part in it!), the teams that reached the final were duty bound to produce a wailed dirge for the general amusement of the public, some of which are still remembered and sung on the terraces to this day.

It has to be said, it’s not often you come across a football-related website with its own official song but we like to think of ourselves as different from all those other sites so, in the true tradition of the FA Cup of old we have procured (with his full consent) the lyrics of a song written for us by a friend of the website, Mr. Dylan Ross. He has also kindly allowed us to publish his own interpretation of the song for all to enjoy (ED – And NOW he’s only gone and recorded it. So here it is in all it’s glory [TUNE!!!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIsKJRNlVnI&feature=channel)).

Formerly of the band [threefortenpound](http://www.reverbnation.com/34£10), Dylan began writing and performing music many years ago. Feeling disillusioned by both the quality of England World Cup records and the lack of romance in modern football, Dylan scribbled these lyrics on the back of a fag packet (or similar) and performed his a capella version of the song in front of amazed friends and onlookers outside a pub in High Wycombe. The lyrics, as I’m sure you will agree, are still as relevant to today’s game as they were back then.

Despite the fact that Dylan’s version of the song is exceptional, both Dylan and we at the therealfacup would like to hear from any other budding musicians out there who would like to rework the song. So if you feel like showing off your talents, please send us your mp3 to <admin@therealfacup.co.uk> and we will gladly post it here for the world to listen to.

Maybe we can change the world with music? Maybe not.
