Coupe de France timing fail.

Confolens is on the Vienne, had I been a boating type I could have pitched up at my folks gaff in France and pedalloed a way up the river to Confoelns. A) it’s up stream, b) it’s 45mins on the car. So, no. 300 people

You go half way across the world, well, halfway down France and you bump into a former Aldershot and Raith player. Eleven years ago he was at Celtic Park wowing the faithful in a 4-0 Cup defeat. 8 goals in his firt 20 games seemed to endear hi to the faithful but just a few weeks kater he was fined for spitting in the face of an Alloa defender. A few months later he was fined for getting pissed the night before a game against Morton. In some ways very French, in other ways not. He moved to Aldershot the following year and signed for Cumnock in 2007 after a spell in the French 3rd Division. Who’d have thunk it.

Confolens v Auvezere Foot 19.

Confolens 3rd 2 points off the top, Auvezere 3rd bottom with 6pts but only 1 off bottom. Confolens won 4-1 away at Limoges B last week, opening the scoring with, “une sublime frappe” from 40 yards from Ivan M’Balla. They certainly score a lot of goals, the front two have 11 between them, 37 year old attacking midfielder M’Balla (formerly of Angouelme) has 5 and Bibou Lacouture, who appears to [fancy himself somewhat](http://fr-fr.facebook.com/bibou.lacouture), with 6.

So, quite a sulky forward line then, no wonder they’re a bit erratic.

The Confolentais celebrate 20 years this year, youngsters, although there was a club prior to that but a merger made them start over and demoted them to PH and they’ve been promoted twice since. Here’s the old club winning promotion in 1976.

Confolens boss is Damien Coutand.

Stadium: Stade Gary Pailler

lob while Auvezere lost 3-0 at home to League leaders Isle Ja. Sounds easy. Well, not necessarily, Confolens lost 4-1 at home the week before to struggling Rihac Rancon but won away 3- in the previous game. They’ve also lost 6-0 and tonked in a couple of hauls themselves. So, who knows what will happen.
