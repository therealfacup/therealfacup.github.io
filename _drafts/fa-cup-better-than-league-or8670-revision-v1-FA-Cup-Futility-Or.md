… The Pointlessness Of Average FA Cup Attendance Stats.

Six years ago we started this thing, though it was not really committed to zeroes and ones until a few months later. We noticed that coverage of the early rounds of the cup was minimal, apart from a few tuned-in clubs and some early adopters of DIY ‘journalism’ that were already well-established. We had high-falutin’ ideas that we could play a small part in increasing the exposure.

Four and a half years on from that start we assessed what we’d found and came up with this.

> We know small clubs are very poorly supported and that is partly because ‘fans’ are only interested in the big clubs. It is also true that national media isn’t that interested in lower league football. However, it’s also clear that part of the problem is that lower league clubs have absolutely no understanding of how to market themselves …
> 
> We have been greeted warmly by the vast majority of teams but few actively embraced the fact we were trying to help them and bring them to a bigger audience. OK, that sounds ludicrously patronising and we aren’t exactly the BBC but you get our drift, we do get a few hits! …
> 
> We couldn’t understand why many clubs seemed not to want the extra coverage they might get from us interviewing their star player or manager or writing about their game. We couldn’t understand why these clubs weren’t obeying the natural and insatiable rules of football and the media.
> 
> But, hey, big news, some of them didn’t want the coverage, they didn’t want the money, they didn’t want big shot players, they didn’t want bells, whistles or gold teeth. It turned out they just wanted to play football! That is not bizarre, it is perfectly normal. That is what we were looking for and we found it. And we got annoyed with it. And we wanted to turn it into the very thing we wanted to get away from. The thing we were disillusioned with.
> 
> Doh!
> 
> WE ARE SORRY.

However, in the last four and a half years things have changed, in fact it has been quite remarkable. We follow on Twitter as many non-league teams as we are aware of (about 600), the vast majority of these now have their own websites and supporters’ sites, which are updated regularly, podcasts, youtube channels and indeed some even have dedicated (unpaid) marketers. Needs must, it seems nowadays.

Undoubtedly this is down to the boom in web-literacy generally and nothing to do with us but the lower reaches of the football pyramid have, in five short years, dragged themselves into the 21st century and have created their own pathway to their local public and potential fans.

Whether this has equated to a surge in attendances generally is not clear but in the #FACup it seems to have done. However, something we have noticed over time is that there is a trend. That trend is, for non league football, exactly the same as in professional football. We wrote, here, about the annual January FA Cup attendance scare. Just google ‘FA Cup attendances’ and you’ll find a story in most national publications about how attendances in the FA Cup, especially the 3rd Round, and this and the general attendance point above made us take a closer look.

Over the last 5 seasons we had a look at average attendances throughout the qualifying rounds of the FA Cup and discovered that they were all over the place, something not uncommon in the later rounds (insert link to piece in FA Cup 4th round increase). There are many factors that have affect attendance averages. Firstly, is a well-supported club home or away? Are well-supported clubs knocked out early? Is a phoenix club drawn at home?

The stats. Last year’s FA Cup 4th Qualifying Round saw the lowest average attendance for five years. Is this a worry or even relevant? On closer inspection, no. Well supported sides like, Luton, Cambridge and Lincoln were draw away from home, unlike previous years, which dragged the average down a lot. Also, a few more very low ranked sides were drawn at home and got deep into the cup so their meagre attendances did little for the overall average.

As if to add weight to this, the averages for the 3rd and 2nd Qualifying rounds last year were the largest since 2009/10. So, this is not necessarily an accurate way to assess the popularity of the FA Cup? No, it isn’t, which instantly illustrates flaws in all of the aforementioned national newspaper pieces wailing at falling attendances.

However, if you look at the stats a little differently you can see things a little more clearly. it’s all about comaprisons.

For last seasons’s FA Cup we looked at the FA Cup attendance of any team who played 3 or more games in the FA Cup qualifying rounds, we calculated an avergae bu also looked at each attendance in isolation – admittedly this method has it’s own issues but is as good a place to start with the time and resources at our disposal.

Until we got bored we found 24 sides who played three or more home games in the Qualifying rounds of last season’s FA Cup. Our headline findings show that all 24 clubs had a higher average attendance in the FA Cup than they did in the league. This is not entirely a surprise, having payed three FA Cup home games in one year you’re on a “Cup Run”, it generates interest and, most likely, you will be playing unfamiliar teams from higher up the football pyramid or around the country. This stat, therfore, is also largely worthless.

It gets a little more interesting when you look at the individual attendances in the context of league and cup averages. 33% of the (24) clubs managed to attract more than their league average number of fans to all of their FA Cup games. This surprised us a fair bit given that down in the Preliminary rounds clubs tend to play opponents familiar to them, often from the same league. If the FA Cup is dying on it’s arse this figure would surely be worse. The sharp eyed among you, though, will notice that this also means that 66.6% of teams did have lower crowds, which does somewhat suggest the opposite.

However, if you look past the very first game each team played things change markedly. Then you get 63% of teams with higher average crowds in the FA Cup than in the league. If you move onto the 3rd game then things change a lot, 92% have FA Cup attendances higher than their league average – in many cases significantly higher (between 3 and 14 times the average). Only two teams had attendances in their 3rd FA Cup (home) game lower than their league average and, interestingly, they were both midweek replays.

So, in short, whether you start in the Extra Preliminary Round, 1st Qualifying Round, 3rd Qualifying Round or 3rd Round Proper, your average attendance for that game is likely to be below your league average. Beyond that, fill yer boots. So, bar \[insert team’s name\] first game in the FA Cup, your FA Cup attendance and averages (pffrt stats) is almost certain to be larger than your verage league attendance, which in turn suggests that the FA Cup is actually not only in rood health but is more popular than tedious league football and it only takes one win for the majority of fans to get their tin foil cups out and get on board the fun bus.

From this conclusion you can put into context the annual FA Cup 3rd Round attendance scare. There isn’t one, it is now common for 3rd Round day to be anticlimactic to many fans of Premier League and Championship fans. This is understandable but if their team wins just one game they will be clamouring fo tickets to the next game, as you can see from this (and many other pieces like it), FA Cup attendances can be up on 4th Round day. And, when the number of teams get trimmed down beyond that round, the average attendance is very much dependent on who is left in and whether the better supported side (or the one with the biggest ground) is drawn at home.

In short, drawing a conclusion from average FA Cup attendances is largely pointless. If you got to the end of the piece, I hope you enjoyed us wasting five minutes of your precious time \[smiley face\].

Cheers.
