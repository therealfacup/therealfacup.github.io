**North Greenford Utd 2-1 Harrow Borough**  
 **FA Cup 1st Qualifying Round Replay 2013/14**

We’ve been to 4,327 FA Cup games and at last we’ve seen a SHOCK! Not a huge shock but a shock.

Ryman Premier League strugglers Harrow Borough were who we once hoped would beat Chesterfield but … didn’t pan out.

Manager Dave Anderson was livid with the team’s performance on Saturday so we thought we’d keep an eye on him.
