**UPDATE: DUE TO LACK OF DEMAND THIS QUIZ IS CANCELLED**

<del>The 2015/16 FA Cup gets underway on Friday 14 August and this season we thought we’d do something to celebrate. Everyone loves the FA Cup, right? Everyone loves quizzes, right? Everyone loves pubs, right? So, we’ve invented a thing called an FA Cup pub quiz! Why no one has done it before beats us.</del>

<del>**Date: Wednesday 12th August**</del>  
<del>  **Time: 7:30-9:30(ish)**</del>  
<del>  **Venue: TBC, Central London**</del>  
<del>  **Teams: Four/Five players**</del>  
<del>  **Registration/Entry Fee: Nominal £1 per person**</del>  
<del>  **Prizes: Hopefully some (probably none)**</del>

<del>Get a team together and drop us a line at ***admin@therealfacup.co.uk***</del>

<del>Obviously, being The Real FA Cup, we can guarantee a little bit of non league cup shenanigans, though not enough to dissuade you, hopefully. One thing we can promise is that there will be no mention of R\*\*\*\*e R\*\*\*\*\*d.</del>
