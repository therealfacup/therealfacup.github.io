It’s very rare that you go to a football match and, for the first time, set eyes upon an unknown who makes you smile and feel grateful to be there. A few years back we visited Champion Hill and saw Sanchez Ming light up a game with his pace and directness. Around about the same time we saw WEST HAM ACADEMY OF FOOTBALL’s classy Roger Stanislas make his loan debut for Southend, during which his well justified self-confidence allowed him to grab the ball off more senior players at a 25 yard free kick, plonk the ball down, take a few steps back and casually curl the ball into the top corner.

This phenomenon hasn’t happened for a while but last night it happened twice. At Champion Hill I (Damon) got my first glimpse of Ellis Green, the player The Real FA Cup has sponsored for the season. And he looks quite the little gem. He scored the first goal and was lively throughout and it was exciting knowing we had, somewhat fortuitously, got to sponsor someone who gave us a warm glow. We’ve yet to see this exactly but it’s coming!

We were slightly prepared for Ellis though, Simon had already seen him play a few weeks earlier. What we weren’t prepared for was Erhun Oztemun. As the game kicked off South London treasure Robert Vaughan told me he’d impressed on his debut on Sunday and to look out for him. We didn’t need long, straight from the kick off this diminutive midfielder was burning his class on our retinas. It’s not easy to justifiably describe swift, subtle and intricate movement, you really need to go and see for yourself. As Hugo Langton said to us on Twitter last night, Erhun is “a prospect. Gavin Rose will look after him, he’s at the right place”. He’s not wrong on any of those three things.

Oh yeah, we went to a game, didn’t we … Hamlet and Godalming know each other fairly well but should have a level of empathy with each other after the end-of-season circus threw them a similar fate. Since current Limassol striker Chris Dickson netted a hatrick in Hamlet’s 8-1 destruction of the G’s in 2006 and then played his last game for Hamlet in the 2-0 win in the reverse fixture later that season, this regular Ryman League tie has proven to be quite unpredictable. Last season a 2-2 draw at Wey Court was preceded by the G’s 1-0 win at Champion Hill. The season before that Dulwich won three times, including a Cup penalty shoot out win, but before that was a Godalming ‘double’ and then a season of stalemate.

But the empathy … in last year’s playoffs both sides suffered the ignominy of exceptionally narrow defeat at the hands of eventual winners, Bognor. With the close-season, Godalming’s location at the western edge of the Ryman catchment area and the proliferation of Kent sides and the restructuring in Sussex meant they moved (literally) sideways and into the Southern League. So, it looked like it would be a while before the two sides crossed paths again. Just a few months later, fate and the FA Cup drew them back together for another 2-2 draw that led to this glorious replay.

After an even and cagey first couple of minutes, Godalming were gifted the chance to open the scoring. A mixture of sitter-missed, good save and woodwork contrived to prevent that from happening and Hamlet took this reprieve by spending teh next 20 minutes more or less camped in the G’s half. In this year of stunning Olympic triumph, the town of Godalming can look back 100 years with some pride at one of their own, Arthur Knight, actually winning a gold medal in football. Of course, he didn’t play for Godalming, the club of choice back then was the toffs playground of the Old Carthusians, Charterhouse School’s old boys network

Appears in Domesday Book 1086

Mary Toft, hoaxed the town into believing she’d given birth to rabbits. She did this by inserting bits of rabbit into ‘herself’ … and ruined the career of several prominent physicians who she had duped, after confessing to the fraud was charged with being ‘a vile cheat and imposter’, although was never convicted.

First town to get a public electric supply, in 1881, when the town’s Charterhouse school’s (Genesis formed here) Old Carthusians side won the FA Cup but returned to gas lighting in 1884.
