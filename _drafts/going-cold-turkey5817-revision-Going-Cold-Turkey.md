**These are the views of Damon and do not necessarily reflect those of therealfacup** …

Well, I’m sure it’s all been said, so I don’t think I’m going to add much to the party but the EPPP storm has broken me. For years now I’ve been dismissive of professional football and condescending towards those who consume it voraciously. I’m sure that’s all been very tedious for you. Sorry. At the same time I’ve always kept my eye in but the dissatisfaction levels have been increasing and, now, I’ve had enough.

You can read elsewhere what this means to people and to the game as a whole, The 72 say [this](http://theseventytwo.com/football-league/championship/2011/10/22/sandbags-and-landgrabs-the-elite-player-performance-plan/), 200% says [this](http://www.twohundredpercent.net/?p=15707) and [this](http://www.twohundredpercent.net/?p=15715) and The Two Unfortunates say [this](http://thetwounfortunates.blogspot.com/2011/10/eppp-exposes-football-league-impotence.html). All of those make salient points with which I agree so there is little point in me regurgitating. So, rather than that, I’m going to tell you what I’m doing about it. It will have little impact, individually, and might appear, on the surface, to be overtly reactionary, painfully well-meaning, buttock-clenchingly twee and, well, all slightly childish. Don’t care. Nurrrh! I’m not only throwing my toys out of the pram, I’m taking the pram down the tip. The Premier League and the Football League are dead to me. Yes, I know, all a bit 6th form and idealistic.

You’ll not see me at a professional football match in England ever again. Sky Sports is eight years dead anyway but now for the rest. No more MOTD on iPlayer (haven’t watched live for several years anyway), Hansen &amp; The Chipmunks are unwatchable so the availability of &gt;ffwd&gt; on iPlayer is essential. My Twitter feed has been purged of ‘official’ professional football (even TWTD!), my bookmarks now have a hole where once there was a direct link to the BBC football page, iTunes is several podcasts lighter – gone is Football Weekly (I’ll miss you Barry, I’ll miss you Jimbo), gone is The Game (I’ll not miss Marcotti) – and sport sections of newspapers are to be instantly binned. Basically, I am opting out. I am refusing to purchase that which either funds or perpetuates the professional game.

As you can see from the above links, blogs remain. Well, I’m not going to cut off my nose to spite professional football, these people may well be dealers of the drug but they don’t … aaahrrghhh, I’m not justifying my blog reading to you, it’s flimsy and selective but these guys write well, I trust their views, I trust them to say it how it is, I trust them to alert me if there’s anything worth knowing and they don’t directly put money in football’s pocket – as far as I’m aware.

Aside from them, from now on, it’s non-league all the way. To be brutally honest, the FA’s role in this is, frankly, no better and I was very close to ditching the Old Jug too. We’ll see about that. “It’ll never last”, I hear the handful of remaining readers cry. Yes, you might be right but why would I need to feed these ludicrants when I have the above blogs, I have the non league bits of Two Footed Tackle, I have EFW, I have The Ball Is Round, Modus Hopper Random, The Cold End, Beat The First Man, AiTinpot (or is it AiTumour today?) and many, many more.

The EPL has pinched a penny too many, the FL has retained a vertebrae too few. And because of that, I want nothing more to do with them. \*Sulk\*. \*Waaaahhhh\*. Between them they have killed or surrendered too much. Greed is now all encompassing, it’s not even subtle anymore. They rely on our addiction to keep getting away with chipping away at our Saturday. Or Sunday afternoon, or Monday evening …

The one bright spot in this is my team’s ‘NO’ vote against EPPP. Yes, who’d have thought? Marcus Evans does the right thing for once. Shame it’s the last thing I will consciously see him do. I don’t expect anyone to follow me but it would be nice. Imagine … if you removed yourself from the equation and you removed your financial support. If you removed your financial support the game would lose its funding, if the game lost it’s funding maybe the clubs would start doing stuff to get you and that funding back. Or they would die. That will, of course, never happen, it’s too far gone. That being the case, I want nothing more to do with it.

End.

*This is going to be hard. Odds on, I’ll not see out the weekend without a little toke on something.*
