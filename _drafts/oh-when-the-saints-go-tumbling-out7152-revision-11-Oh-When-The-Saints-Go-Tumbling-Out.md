FC Clacton gained a notable but bizarre Fake FA Cup victory at the Rush Green Bowl, in a match that will ignite controversy over whether Premier League teams are taking this fake competition seriously. The record books will show a final score of 2-0 and the presence of the Essex side in the next round. However, in truth the contest soon descended into farce as it gradually became clear that Southampton had rested their entire Premier League squad of 25 and sent their Subbuteo team, all of whom are over forty years old and relatively immobile.

They had trained all week for a confrontation with highly trained and technically adept athletes. Southampton adopted a very defensive approach and hoped that the home side would collapse with exhaustion in the seaside sunshine. With so much time and space, their decision-making faltered and there were no goals in the first half, much to the bemusement of the home fans in the famous “Bus Shelter” stand, some of whom stayed awake throughout.

This had the desired effect, and left-back James Dunkley was the first to realise that all he had to do was head goalwards by himself and round the goalkeeper. Twenty minutes later, after his thirty-seventh pirouette around the goalkeeper, he eventually prodded the ball home much to the relief of the Bus Shelter faithful.

With five minutes to go, Dunkley got his second and sealed the win with a punt from the halfway line. It hit the bar and bounced down, just over the line. Goalline technology has not yet reached the Eastern Counties, and this goal will be talked about for years.

Dunkley thanked his parents. “My Dad, who’s ancient, had Subbuteo as a kid and at half-time I remembered he told me that they couldn’t move by themselves. Thanks, Dad!” Taylor was smiling broadly. “I had a few choice words for the boys at half-time”, he said. “I’m hoping to get Manchester United’s Striker team in the next round.”
