**SEA-GOAL!!!**

No cup magic for Dynamo as feathered forward sends Bees buzzing into next round.

The lovely Natalie Sawyer was in attendance at the Nanpantan Sports Ground to witness something that would have even got Jim White more excited than a stripper in the Sky Sports Studio, five minutes from the end of Transfer Deadline Day. With her Brentford side 3-0 up and cruising in an already-enthralling encounter at 8th tier opponents Loughborough Dynamo, and barely a minute left, you’d have thought there was very little reason to stick around any longer. But as exhausted fans were streaming out the ground, a fairly innocuous cross from Sam Saunders met the path of a rather large overhead seagull, swooping down unwittingly, causing one of the most bizarre moments ever seen on a football pitch as it bobbled beyond startled Dynamo goalkeeper Laurie Pearson, and trickled over the line.

Amidst all the laughter and confusion from the remaining travelling Brentford fans, there was much deliberation as to whether the goal should actually stand. The Loughborough players protested as Saunders and co tried their very best to celebrate with dignity, and the local medical staff attended the winded seagull who had been left lying flat out on the pitch. After five minutes discussing with his assistants, referee Trevor Kettle decided to rule in favour of the goal. He later explained his decision; “I wasn’t sure whether to give it at first, as the seagull technically wasn’t part of play. But after five minutes I thought ‘sod it, life’s too short, it’s bloody funny’. And besides, if that beach ball can score up at Sunderland, why can’t a seagull do the same here?”

The day had started with FA Cup fever going around for the hosts from the Northern Premier League Division One South. Literally. An outbreak of flu across the town meant that half the population were struck down with symptoms, including many at the game today and certain members of the playing staff. This led to atmospheric taunts from visiting fans such as “You’re sick, and you know you are” and “Does your Doctor know you’re here?” It was all taken in good humour though, as the 1,000-strong home support wheezed out in unison “Cough your phlegm up for the lads” in response to their more-illustrious and healthy-bodied opponents.
