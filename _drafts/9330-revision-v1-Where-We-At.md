The Real FA Cup is entering its ninth season of existence and perhaps its least visible since the very first.

When we started doing this it was uncommon for non league teams to have websites, let alone a social media presence and that was one of the drivers behind the site, increasing the reach and coverage of the early rounds of the world’s oldest cup competition.

Of course, some local media had Saturday or Sunday coverage in traditional mediums and that continues now for the immediate locality. However, even only eight years ago, coverage of the FACup’s early rounds online often arrived several days later and often only on the FA’s results page, or the few clubs with a clued up fan with a camera and a blog.

In the early days we like to think we filled a void and hopefully played a tiny, tiny part in spreading the word about the early rounds of the FA Cup. Now, almost all teams have a dedicated social media type, the non league media is online and up to date, fans have organised and bloggers and photographers document everything … which is great news and what the competition deserves.

This isn’t a big goodbye from The Real FA Cup but, this season, beyond September, it’s very unlikely this feed will be manned and the website updated with anything of note. Who knows? Anyway, it’s been largely fun. Enjoy the cup.
