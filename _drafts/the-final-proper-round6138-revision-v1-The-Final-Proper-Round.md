If, like us, you were out of the country on important state business, you might have missed the last proper round of the FA Cup. If so, here’s a round-up. Oh – and the draw – some draws won’t have pleased the respective teams but it does mean there will definitely be some non leaguers in action in Round Two!

First up, sad news. The team we adopted last week, largely courtesy of Andy Hudson, Hebburn Town, have gone. Going away to local Blue Square Bet Premier side Gateshead proved too large a task. Despite holding out for nearly an hour, they lost 3-0 and you can read about the build up, features and interviews [here](http://therealfacup.co.uk/?s=hebburn+town&submit.x=0&submit.y=0), no fewer than seven recent pieces! Also, match action [here](http://www.northernleaguefootball.co.uk/index.php/videos/93-videos/167-hebburn-in-fa-cup-exit).

Elsewhere, the minnows fared little better. Hebburn’s fellow Northern League survivors Ashington got hammered [5-0 by Grimsby](http://codalmighty.com/site/ca.php?page=1112/ashington-h-fac/stats&return_to=1112/ashington-h-fac), as did [Gainsborough Trinity by AFC Telford](http://audioboo.fm/boos/524134-gainsborough-trinity-steve-housham-postmatch). [Kidsgrove](http://stickypalms.blogspot.com/2011/10/kidsgrove-athletic-0-bradford-park.html) got dumped out [by Bradford Park Avenue 2-0](http://northernfootball.blogspot.com/2011/10/kidsgrove-athletic-0-bradford-park.html) and Solihull Moors got edged out [1-0 by FC Halifax](http://www.halifaxcourier.co.uk/sport/fc-halifax-town/shaymen_through_to_first_round_1_3921156?). Kings Lynn Town put up quite fight against the mighty Tamworth but still succumbed, [the Lambs sneaking through 2-1](http://www.edp24.co.uk/sport/kings-lynn-fc/fa_cup_tamworth_2_king_s_lynn_town_1_1_1112437). Finally, Southend Manor of the Essex Senior League put up a valiant effort against Kettering Town, after holding them to 1-1 at half time – the second half proved more tricky and they [lost 3-1](http://thisisntkettering.wordpress.com/2011/10/30/the_road_to_wembley_fa_cup_kettering_town_southend_manor_jp_marna_leon_mckenzie/).

There were some high points though, [Hinckley Town held Darlington 1-1](http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/sport/9334010.Quakers_held_by_Hinckley/?), Redbridge stunned BSB Premier side Ebbsfleet 2-0, East Thurrock United won 2-1 away at Eastbourne Borough, Arlesey Town beat Forest Green Rovers 2-1. Elsewhere, Natalia Bradford saw [Mansfield 1-1 Fleetwood](http://nataliajbradford.wordpress.com/2011/10/30/honours-even-mansfield-town-a-fa-cup-4th-qualifying-round/).

Topping off the round, friend of and contributor to therealfacup, Graham Yapp, went to Totton to watch them progress to the First Round for the first time ever – [AFC Totton 3-2 Hanworth Villa](http://modushopperrandom.blogspot.com/2011/10/totton-up-prize-money.html) – while 200% have, as usual, collated some of the [best bits of video](http://www.twohundredpercent.net/?p=15920) from the round. And, talking of video, here’s the latest installment of the Bromley chaps [video blog](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I77hluobsJ0&feature=youtu.be), for their 2-1 win over Dartford.

As you can see from our links, the local media have a vital place in the FA Cup but if you’ve come across any blogs about any of the games, let us know and we’ll add them here.

There’s a few replays to sort but the draw was made yesterday – it is on the FA website. The pick of our area’s ties is without doubt Redbridge v Oxford City. The chance for either to get to Round Two is astonishing! Bromley’s trip to Leyton Orient stands out too, it’s quite a task but one Bromley aren’t incapable of.

Thanks to all people keeping us up to date with games on Twitter. Apologies if we don’t reply or RT everything, we were away this weekend, so please keep on keeping on … and good luck to Blyth, Alfreton, Hinckley and Leatherhead in the replays!

*And, finally, welcome to the mainstream media – putting so much back in to football by turning up half way through a competition. Well done …*
