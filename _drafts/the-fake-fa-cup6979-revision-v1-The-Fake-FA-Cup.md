We asked you what changes you’d make to the FA Cup and you told us. We liked them so much we decided to change the FA Cup, because we can. And along the way, it is you who will help shape what happens and how it happens … possibly.

This year’s Fake FA Cup will soon start and will take the following format:

There are 757 entrants, all of these teams will be in the draw for the Preliminary Round but only 490 teams will be drawn, giving 245 ties. The remaining 267 get byes to Round 1, which will be a straight draw between 512 teams. There will then be seven more rounds until we reach the grand final. See how easy this Cup organisation can be!

> Preliminary Round = 490 teams  
> Round 1 = 245 + 267 = 512 teams  
> Round 2 = 256 teams  
> Round 3 = 128 teams  
> Round 4 = 64 teams  
> Round 5 = 32 teams  
> Round 6 = 16 teams  
> QF = 8 teams  
> SF = 4 teams  
> F = 2 teams

**Rule Changes:**  
No teams allowed to switch ties, the team drawn at home plays at home.  
No extra time, all ties to go to replays until resolved.  
One featured game per round.  
The first two rounds will be drawn by therealfacup, the rest will be drawn by whoever is granted the right to do so and, indeed, wants to do so. DO YOU WANT IT ENOUGH!?

So, given these games won’t actually exist, how do we figure out the results? Well, we’re going old school, we’re delving into pointless games of our past, such as [card cricket](http://www.pagat.com/patience/cricket.html). All but one of the games from each round will be decided by the convoluted drawing of playing cards, with the scoring system (which we reserve the right to change at any time) as follows:

> 1 Goal = Aces, Jacks and Queens  
> 2 Goals = Twos and Kings  
> 3 Goals = Threes  
> 4 Goals = Fours  
> 5 Goals = Fives of Hearts &amp; Diamonds  
> 6 Goals = Six of Hearts  
> 7 Goals = Seven of Hearts (Looking forward to the 7-6 results!)  
> 0 Goals = The rest of the Fives, Sixes, Sevens, Eights, Nines and Tens

Joker = Wildcard. This can be any number of goals from 0-90 and will be decided on a whim by someone of our choosing.

What do you reckon? Not enough goals?

But what about the ‘featured game’, the ‘all but one game from each round’? Well, that’s where you come in. We intend doing a series of challenges, hopefully with supporters of the teams involved, that will decide the result. These challenges will be announced at random times, around the time the games will be played (which, knowing us, are likely to be at random times), and we’ll canvas you for suggestions. It could be a pre-match darts game, maybe a ‘who has the tallest fan’ competition, maybe a ‘best tinfoil cup’ challenge?? Who knows, it’s entirely up to you!

Actually, you know, that is not all. Oh no! If you have any ideas how we can improve this, tell us. This is a very stupid game but putting some control back into the hands of fans and making it all a bit more egalitarian, well, that’s good right – the divisions between rich and poor are eradicated. Hmmm … radical thought but, if enough people complain about one of the results, maybe we’ll change it, mwahahahahahaaaaa.
