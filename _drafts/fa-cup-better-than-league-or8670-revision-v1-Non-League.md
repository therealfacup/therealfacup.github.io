Six years ago we started this thing, though it was not really committed to zeroes and ones until a few months later. We noticed that coverage of the early rounds of the cup was minimal, apart from a few tuned-in clubs and some early adopters of DIY ‘journalism’ that were already well-established. We had high-falutin’ ideas that we could play a small part in increasing the exposure.

Four and a half years on from that start we assessed what we’d found and came up with this.

> We know small clubs are very poorly supported and that is partly because ‘fans’ are only interested in the big clubs. It is also true that national media isn’t that interested in lower league football. However, it’s also clear that part of the problem is that lower league clubs have absolutely no understanding of how to market themselves …

> We have been greeted warmly by the vast majority of teams but few actively embraced the fact we were trying to help them and bring them to a bigger audience. OK, that sounds ludicrously patronising and we aren’t exactly the BBC but you get our drift, we do get a few hits! …
> 
> We couldn’t understand why many clubs seemed not to want the extra coverage they might get from us interviewing their star player or manager or writing about their game. We couldn’t understand why these clubs weren’t obeying the natural and insatiable rules of football and the media.
> 
> But, hey, big news, some of them didn’t want the coverage, they didn’t want the money, they didn’t want big shot players, they didn’t want bells, whistles or gold teeth. It turned out they just wanted to play football! That is not bizarre, it is perfectly normal. That is what we were looking for and we found it. And we got annoyed with it. And we wanted to turn it into the very thing we wanted to get away from. The thing we were disillusioned with.

> Doh!

> WE ARE SORRY.

What has happened over the last four and a half years is quite remarkable. We follow on Twitter as many non-league teams as we are aware of (about 600), the vast majority of these now have their own websites and supporters’ sites, which are updated regularly, podcasts, youtube channels and indeed some even have dedicated (unpaid) marketers.

Undoubtedly this is not down to the boom in web-literacy generally and nothing to do with us but the lower reaches of the football pyramid have, in five short years, dragged themselves into the 21st century and have created their own pathway to their local public and potential fans.

Whether this has equated to a surge in attendances is not clear
