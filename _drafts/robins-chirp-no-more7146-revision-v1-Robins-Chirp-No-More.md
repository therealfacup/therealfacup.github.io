<div>An epic journey undertaken by men  
of courage, while others take overseas tours,  
these well-sized Blues, true, take a ride in a van,  
from the Isthmian League to the Yorkshire moors.  
Two down! But they rally, and claw their way back –  
a hat-trick from Brothers, and Heath makes it four,  
Selby rock on their heels, Smy sly in attack  
Far from Rigid, the poor Robins chirped no more.</div>Gone are the memories of Fleetwood Town  
Forcing a replay to go 2-0 down,  
To write a new page in their history,  
March from Victory Road to victory!  
‘Tis moments like these, make you feel alive:  
it ends, Selby Town 2, and Leiston 5.

Sonnet forged by the hand of [Philippa B](https://twitter.com/Philby1976).
