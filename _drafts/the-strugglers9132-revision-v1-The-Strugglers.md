<div>In case you were wondering, here’s some extensive research into the TEN lowest placed teams left in this year’s FA Cup Preliminary Round. OK, OK, we’re only one round in to this year’s competition but you have to start somewhere … All are from level 10 in the pyramid and here is the current list of them with league position.

> 1\. Witheridge (18th South West Peninsula Prem)

Witheridge may be 18th in the league but they have only lost one of their four games this season. They are away at Street in the tier above (Western Premier) but the Cobblers have only managed one point this season and are themselves hovering around the relegation places at this early stage. Minor upset on the cards?

> 2\. Wincanton Town (17th Western League Div 1)

If it’s upsets you want then this one will be one of the biggest of the round. Wincanton face high-flying Winchester City two tiers and 55 places above them in the league, currently the equivalent of Port Vale beating Manchester City. This looks like the biggest gap between two sides but we’re happy to be disproved!

> 3\. Christchurch (14th Wessex League Div1)

Christchurch are a tier below their Western League Premier opponents, Bradford Town but the Bobcats are another struggling side who could be ripe for an upset. If it’s idylls you want, though, a trip to Bradford-on-Avon will be one of the more attractive trips of the round.

> 4\. Long Buckby (13th United Counties League Div 1)

It’s difficult to call Long Buckby’s chances in this. They’ve only played two leagues games due to cup replays but those two games have seen 12 goals, a massive away win and a comfortable home defeat. The goals may stand them in good stead against a Daventry side who got to the FA Cup 1st Round two years ago and were one of our teams of the year. Daventry are mid-table in the Northern Premier (1 South) but are shipping more than two goals a game. Bound to be 0-0.

> 5\. Heaton Stannington (11th Northern Legue Div 2)

Heaton Stan are currently slap bang in the middle of the Northern League 2nd division and face a struggling Whitley Bay side at their lowest ebb for years. The heady days of their Vase triple are becoming a distant memory for Bay and their patchy recent form has seen them slip into the bottom half of the Northern League’s first division. There is a real feel-good factor around the Stan though and it has the air of a cup run about it. A trip to the North East coast, however, isn’t an easy one but a draw or even a win is not beyond them.

> 5\. Almondesbury (11th Western League Div 1)

Almondesbury have already pulled off a minor shock by beating Fawley from a tier above. They have to do it again this time as well as they host Verwood Town of the Wessex Premier League, also struggling near the bottom of the table.

> 7\. Seven Acre Sidcup (10th Kent Invicta League)

Tonight Seven Acre &amp; Sidcup host Sittingbourne of the Ryman Division 1 South, two tiers above. Both have had so-so starts in their respective leagues though Seven Acre have played a few games fewer. But this would be an upset and, in Tony Fenech, Seven Acre have a striker fresh from two good performances [in the previous round](http://therealfacup.co.uk/2015/08/17/even-sevens/).

> 7\. Raunds Town (10th United Counties League Div 1)

Raunds are the second side in this list who face a very tough challenge. They visit [Beaconsfield SYCOB ](http://www.getbucks.co.uk/sport/football/news/beaconsfield-sycob-boss-eyes-fa-9947488)from two tiers above who are undefeated this season, lie 2nd in the central section of Southern League Division 1 and are 50 places above Raunds. The Shopmates (??!!) stingy defence may hold them in good stead but it’s bound to be difficult.

> 7\. AFC Emley (10th Northern Counties East Div 1)

They of the marvellous raffle prize and subject of [review](http://therealfacup.co.uk/2015/08/17/breakfast-at-emleys/) and [preview](http://therealfacup.co.uk/2015/08/26/six-o6/) (of their game against Burscough) on this site already this season. Popular. And, why not, what a prize! Click through on the above link for Graham Yapp’s preview.

> 10\. Risborough Rangers (9th Spartan South Midland Div 1)

Risborough are clearly the side in this list doing the best in their respective league but they are another side giving away two tiers and 48 league places to their opposition, Aylesbury (the moles, not the ducks). Aylesbury are only two points off the top of the central section of the Southern League Division 1 but they’re letting in a few goals as well. Who knows, dare to dream, Risborough.
