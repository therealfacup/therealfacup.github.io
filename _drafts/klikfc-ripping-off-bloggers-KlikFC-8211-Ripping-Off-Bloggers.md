Hello people, a bit of a rant here about a company who reproduced our copyrighted material without authorisation and without giving it sufficient acknowledgement.

KlikFC claim to be all about Youth Football but, in truth, they are really just an aggregator of football stories. This is not new, not unique or indeed revelatory. KlikFC do not ask you if they can reproduce your copyrighted material and, again, this is not new or indeed particularly grubby, although of course it would be polite and commonly decent to ask. However, unlike most aggregating sites, KlikFC do not signpost who is the author of the copyrighted content they reproduce. They do not stick your logo next to your copy with a hyperlink to your site. No, all they do is insert a small, insignificant, barely noticeable little link that says ‘View original’.

For all intents and purposes the copy looks like theirs, which of course it isn’t. Now, we know the game and we’re on other aggregating sites but on those sites it is clear who wrote the piece and we get traffic through from those sites in the symbiotic way intended. With KlikFC, we get no traffic, evidently because no one knows we wrote OUR pieces so why would they click through to some place they do not know exists. And, in any case, no one would have noticed the ‘View original’ button.

So, why do you need to know about this? Well, your copy is probably on there as well. We’ve stumbled across the copy of a few others we follow and, similarly, that copy is also not sufficiently acknowledged. What is particularly galling is that KlikFC is ‘partners’ with the Guardian and their logo appears with ubiquity and, on the vast majority of Guardian pieces we’ve read, they even have links to the individual staff writer!

This is the Guardian, the mecca of football writing in England. Some might argue that with so many Guardian Logos prominent on the KlikFC site that visitors might even think this blogger content is Guardian writing!? Do the Guardian know this?

Finally though, I only decided to write this because, being the inveterate copyright thieves that KlikFC are, this blog will, in time, be up on their own site and I, for one, thought that would be fucking funny.

Cheers, Damon.
