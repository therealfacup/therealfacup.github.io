Fake FA Cup Preliminary Round – Saturday 4th August 2012

Dr Billyo at Imperial Fields

The early season Fake FA Cup preliminary round came too early in the season for both sets of players as they meandered through 90 minutes of lacklustre football at Imperial Fields this afternoon. Not helped by the relentless sun and sweltering temperatures, which forced the game to be played at walking pace for much of the afternoon. The visitors started brightly, passing the ball forwards 6 inches at the kick-off, but this was the limit of their positive attacking play for much of the first half. The Moatmen were obviously watching Ray Wilkins DVDs on the team coach as for the rest of the 1st half they passed sideways only when a backwards pass wasn’t available, looking to retain possession and take the tie back to Derbyshire, when they will hope for cooler temperatures a week Tuesday.

Tooting &amp; Mitcham hardly seemed bothered by the Gresley tactics and were content to let their visitors play keepball in their own half. Tooting &amp; Mitcham Chairman Barry North explained before kick off that a number of their players had been delayed on a flight returning from pre-season “training” in Malaga the night before and had only arrived back in London in the small hours of the morning. So perhaps it was not surprising in the heat that a few Terrors players had that summer holiday feeling. Though Tooting keeper Jack Giddins was nearly left with egg on his face when a mis-hit punt-out for an injury by Gresley keeper Tom Gutteridge found him lying on his towel in the 6-yard box topping up his tan, but thankfully for the hosts, the ball bobbled just wide.

Despite Round 1 of the Fake FA Cup being there for the team that would be willing to break into a sweat the 2nd half continued in the same vein as the first and when Roberto Forzoni and Gary Norton the managers of both sides both left their dugouts on 60 minutes together and headed to the bar, you sensed that both sides had settled for a replay.

There was to be late drama though; on 85 minutes, when, having both spent the best part of two hours in their hot costumes, the heat became too much for both mascots as they began fighting on the touchline. Although starting with gentle shoving when Elvis Gresley pushed Terror the Tiger for passing the ball too quickly back to Gresley striker Dean Oliver, the disagreement soon turned into a no-holds barred wrestling match as the two mascots rolled around punching each other near the Tooting Corner flag. As the majority of fans, players and officials were distracted by the fluffy fisticuffs, Bertie Brayley and Conner French combined well together to waltz through the Gresley defence and French slotted home, just as the referee called a halt to proceedings. Whether play should be allowed to continue while two men dressed as a dog and a tiger are fighting at the other end of the pitch is debatable, but in this case I think the referee, Mr B Lindbat of Camden got the call right. He was probably just grateful to have something to do.

The teams will meet again at the Moat Ground in Church Gresley in 10 days time, when hopefully they’ll have more stomach for a football match and be willing to break into a sweat.
