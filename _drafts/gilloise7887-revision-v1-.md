The Real FA Cup goes continental: Belgium.

First up … we are MASSIVE hipsters, just look at us, so where better for MASSIVE hipsters to go than current MASSIVE little hipster club number one, Zulte Waregem. EsseVee have been waging war against the MASSIVE (enough ‘MASSIVE’) beer-swillers of Belgian football for no less than several weeks! Top of the league and Anderlecht recently vanquished, a win against humdrum Genk would leave them with the league title in their own tiny hands. NOTHING CAN GO WRONG NOW! We turned up, they got smashed 4-0 at home, missed a penalty, squabbled amongst themselves and lost top spot … we’ll move along from there because we’re not actually hipsters. Honest.

The second game saw a new high for us. These pages are littered with missed goals thanks largely to our inability to stop drinking at half time. Our record goals-missed tally is three in one game! We managed to equal that here.

Just 25mins from Kortrijk by train, our Gent base was bathed in sunshine, in the shadow of as fine a castle as you’ll stumble cross, Flemish stew lining the gut and Gulden Draak slipping down nicely. NOTHING CAN GO WRONG NOW. We awoke the next morning with heavy heads, having danced the night away in Gent’s answer to Ritzy’s, ‘Charlatans’. Oh, the game? We managed to miss all of it thanks largely to 70s funk and 80s electro soul. Result? Kortrijk 0-3 Lierse. We’re doing well here. The Real FA Cup, feared by home sides across Europe.

What you need after that is a 40 minute train ride where you have to stand the whole way and then trudge blindly into sunburn to a football ground. But when it’s a trudge towards Brussels’ Duden Park and the the majestic Stade Joseph Marien, the home of Royal Union St Gilloise, your trudge is football’s answer to Anadin.

Both top flight teams we saw (or should have seen) were actually in the same division as Union less than ten years ago, they are both highly, upwardly mobile. Union’s final game of a troubled season pitted them against newly crowned Champions Excelsior Virton and they had to win to stand any chance of staying up. Cruel. And with us on board … NOTHING CAN GO WRONG NOW!

Back in the day, Union were big cheeses in Belge, 11 time champions and two time cup winners but their last bauble of note was in 1935. Their lovely stadium would have been rocking back then and it hosted some footy in the 1920 Olympics. As recently as 1960 they were battling Roma in the semi final of what was then the Fairs Cup (UEFA Cup, I mean Europa League, for you youngsters). Today the locals only gets to watch their team in the third tier football, which we were assured was actually quite attractive football hampered only by two major flaws: 1) They can’t put the ball in the net, 2) They can’t defend.

Well, you really need to take a trip to Union, it’s ace. No end terraces, an elaborately fronted main stand and the steepest lower league side terrace we’ve ever seen. Monstrous, so it is, and perfectly appointed to give you the ideal place to sit/stand/lie and sunbathe. And they have a beer window at the top of the stand, so you don’t have to trudge back to the cramped, well-appointed bar with its Panathinaikos crest stencilled on the wall … errr, no idea, it seems to be a green/bhoys/catholic thing but nothing is clear.

The Union team, perhaps aptly, includes six Belgians, an Italian, a Spaniard, a Moroccan, an Armenian and a Rwandan, the latter two (Yagan and Godfroid) are internationals. By contrast, we know nothing of Virton, except that it is about as far away from anywhere that anything in Belgium can be. It is closer to Luxembourg, France and Germany than it is to Brussels. Rumour has it, it takes about 6 hours drive down dirt tracks to even get to the capital, though many of the locals have never even seen a car.

However, the whole team had their hair or heads died green to celebrate their Championship victory and it looked ridiculous on most of them, should have been a regulation yellow card for bringing hairdresing into disrepute. The 13 travelling fans must have been shamed by this open display of celebration, no one wants to see fun in football.

As the game got underway there was a nervous, almost resigned air about the place, in a less than encouraging crowd of no more than 500-600. The RUSG Ultras tried a little then went quiet as they went 1-0 down. The young lass next to us had permanently crossed fingers while the old lady in front of her appeared to berate everyone in the ground for a reason that my pigeon French could not fathom.

Then, a lifeline. A penalty for RUSG thanks to a quite spectacular dive by the right winger. Nerves jangled, the crowd actually told each other to be quiet for the penalty. Never heard that before, either respectful or superstitious? Union’s keeper, on his knees back at the other end, asked for intervention from a higher force. 1-1! Back in the league. Four minutes later, 1-2 happened and the mundane spectre of relegation returned.

Half time and a descent down the north face of the Eiger was required to get to the burgers, no better than English grounds, which required a skip past the scoreboard, which was a mobile phone set back in the trees. Ring-ring. Let’s be honest, that terrace doesn’t look much from the opposite side of the pitch, it’s awe doesn’t properly hit until you get to the foot of it and have to crane your neck to see the top.

The second half started off brightly and Union equalised (2-2) and a third looked on the cards for a good 10 minutes after. It was beginning to look like Union might dig themselves out of trouble. The two teams above Union were playing out a 1-1 draw so a win would have meant Union finished outside the automatic relegation places on goal difference.

Then came Virton’s third, and indeed fourth. Game over, Union lost 2-4 and their relegation to the regional leagues was confirmed. They would have been better served if their field-like pitch had been flattened at some point prior to the game. It was nigh on impossible to play nice football on the worst pitch I’ve ever seen, bumpy and rock hard.

But, just look at that ground! Go.
