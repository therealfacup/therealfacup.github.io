This week, Damon, Bruno, Taylor and Cockles are joined by mate and Kiwi fella Jeff ‘Jiff’ Rodway. [\[raw feed link here\]](http://therealfacup.jellycast.com/podcast/feed/2)

This week’s episode features a round up of the games that had been played at the time + instant reaction to France, South Africa. See if we called Germany and Ghana correctly and how we think the Kiwis will get on today. The regular well of amusement that is ‘Call My Fact’ runs a little dry but there is still room for The Bard, Ilunga Mwepu, Alf Di Stefano, Mark Knofler, Mark Bresciano and some coach theft. The Grand Feature of Underdog will obviously Feature The New Zealand Lions who held Italy last week. Media Watch features Chris Waddle but is very brief. No word from Nick in South Africa just yet but we’ll be hearing from him in the next episode … probably.

We again try, and partly fail, to not talk too much about England and predict the qualifiers – of which we definately got Germany right. Wow! Insight.

Thanks for listening/reading.
