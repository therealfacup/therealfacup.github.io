In a week where the FA Cup came to Moore Lane Park, The Daily Mail and Daily Mirror online both featured the club, Newton Aycliffe’s first ever foray in the most romantic of competitions came to an abrupt end with a 7-2 thrashing at the hands of Billingham Synthonia. On Saturday 20 August expectations of an exciting cup run saw a crowd of 330 turn up on a sunny day hoping for an exciting clash. But as early as the fourth minute Aycliffe were up against it when a long ball from the visitors own half found Collatine, allowing him to cross from the right and give Hillerby the easiest of chances.

They always looked the more likely to score and, on 34 minutes, when a free kick once again found Collatine on the right he delivered a perfect cross for Earl to fire in. On the stroke of half time came probably the best goal of the game when MaGowan’s initial shot was well saved by Andrew Spence in the Aycliffe goal, McGowan showed why you should always chase the rebound and he smashed an unstoppable shot between the keeper and his right hand post.

He completed his hat-trick on 66 when a through ball from Edwards allowed him to beat the off-side trap and chip a nice lob over Spence as he charged out of his goal.

Moody in the the visitors goal saved the first shot but the Aycliffe player was not to be denied the clubs first ever goal in the FA Cup.

There was still time left for Billingham to score a further two goals, the sixth coming when N Jameson threaded the deftest of passes through to Cater for him to hammer the ball past Spence. The seventh goal was due to Mark Peck allowing himself to be robbed of the ball by Edwards who chased-on and rounded the keeper. Edwards never properly celebrated his goal, looking like he felt sorry for Aycliffe.

On the way out of the ground I briefly spoke to my friend John G who is the hospitality manager at the club and the pain and disappointment was clearly etched on his face.
