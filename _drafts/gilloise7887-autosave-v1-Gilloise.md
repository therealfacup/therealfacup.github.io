**The Real FA Cup goes continental: Belgium.**

Royal Union Saint Gilloise **2-4** Excelsior Virton

Belgian Division 3B, May 5 2012

But, first up … we are MASSIVE hipsters, [just look at us,](http://therealfacup.co.uk/about/) so where better for MASSIVE hipsters to go than current MASSIVE little hipster club number one, Zulte Waregem. EsseVee have been waging war against the MASSIVE (enough ‘MASSIVE’) beer-swillers of Belgian football for no less than several weeks! Top of the league and Anderlecht recently vanquished, a win against humdrum Genk would leave them with the league title in their own tiny hands. NOTHING CAN GO WRONG NOW! We turned up, they got smashed 4-0 at home, missed a penalty, squabbled amongst themselves and lost top spot … we’ll move along from there because we’re not actually hipsters. Honest.

Just 25mins from the next destination, Kortrijk, our Gent base was bathed in sunshine, in the shadow of as fine a castle as you’ll stumble cross, Flemish stew lining the gut and Gulden Draak slipping down nicely. NOTHING CAN GO WRONG NOW. The Belgian play offs are delightfully bonkers but, when you have a 6 team league where the winners go through to face another game against the least rubbish team in the top play off group to win the chance to be in the Europa League … a game between the two teams at the bottom of that group is a bit like going to Belgium and only drinking Stella … HANG ON, there is no point explaining this. Gent’s premier NITEKLUB, ‘Charlatans’, was way more enticing than what turned out to be another heavy home defeat. Vidiprinter update: 70s Funk &amp; 80s Electro Soul Rovers 4-0 Football.

What you need after that is a 40 minute train ride and a trudge blindly into sunburn to a football ground. But when it’s a trudge towards Brussels’ Duden Park and the the majestic Stade Joseph Marien, the home of Royal Union St Gilloise, your trudge is football’s answer to Nurofen.

This is a football stadium, did you guess?” type=”image” alt=”IMG\_4325.jpg” pe2\_single\_image\_size=”w640″ pe2\_img\_align=”center” \]

Both top flight teams we saw (or nearly saw) were actually in the same division as Union less than ten years ago, both now highly, upwardly mobile. Union’s final game of a troubled season pitted them against newly crowned Champions Excelsior Virton and they had to win to stand any chance of staying up. Cruel. And with us on board … NOTHING COULD GO WRONG NOW!

\[pe2-image src=”http://lh6.ggpht.com/-iePjo\_thYLc/Ut5Kk9uQGGI/AAAAAAAAEEg/pMrT-H0YuSY/s144-o/400671\_10151678717948974\_2126653910\_n.jpg” href=”https://picasaweb.google.com/117823912047779151886/Gilloise#5971292154844158050″ caption=”In &amp; Out” type=”image” alt=”400671\_10151678717948974\_2126653910\_n.jpg” pe2\_single\_video\_size=”w640″ pe2\_single\_image\_size=”w640″ pe2\_img\_align=”center” \]

Back in the day, Union were big cheeses in Belge, 11 time champions and twice cup winners but their last bauble of note was in 1935 \*whistfully imagines their lovely stadium packed to the rafters with Belgian rattles\* and the Stade hosted some footy in the 1920 Olympics. Even as recently as 1960 Union were battling Roma in the semi final of the Fairs Cup (UEFA Cup, I mean Europa League, for you youngsters). Today the locals only gets to watch their team in the third tier but we were assured the footy was actually quite attractive, only hampered by two slight flaws: 1) They can’t put the ball in the net, 2) They can’t defend. In between, bloody lovely.

\[pe2-image src=”http://lh3.ggpht.com/-vignQ80kfuY/Ut5KjncqMhI/AAAAAAAAEEI/bwZOFmejIHw/s144-o/182696\_10151678701438974\_1437391856\_n.jpg” href=”https://picasaweb.google.com/117823912047779151886/Gilloise#5971292131684921874″ caption=”Champions &amp; Strugglers” type=”image” alt=”182696\_10151678701438974\_1437391856\_n.jpg” pe2\_single\_image\_size=”w640″ pe2\_img\_align=”center” \]

You really need to take a trip to Union, it’s ace. No end terraces, an elaborately fronted main stand replete with carvings of football ‘scenes’ and the steepest lower league side terrace we’ve ever seen. Monstrous, so it is, and perfectly appointed to give you the ideal place to sit/stand/lie and increase your sunburn. Seriously, when did Belgium get tropical, it was 28 degrees! And they have a beer window at the top of the stand! This is good but it means you don’t have to trudge back to the fantastic but cramped, well-appointed bar with its rusting English pub sign outside and the Panathinaikos crest stencilled on the wall … errr, no idea, it seems to be a green/bhoys/catholic thing but nothing is clear.

\[pe2-image src=”http://lh3.ggpht.com/-gBa6psgXYn8/Ut5KkFRQqGI/AAAAAAAAEEQ/SP8ivuZTDRI/s144-o/262533\_10151678716703974\_1849214300\_n.jpg” href=”https://picasaweb.google.com/117823912047779151886/Gilloise#5971292139690174562″ caption=”Deceptively steep terrace” type=”image” alt=”262533\_10151678716703974\_1849214300\_n.jpg” pe2\_single\_image\_size=”w640″ pe2\_img\_align=”center” \]

The Union team, perhaps aptly, includes six Belgians, an Italian, a Spaniard, a Moroccan, an Armenian and a Rwandan, the latter two (Yagan and Godfroid) are internationals with World Cup qualifying experience. By contrast, we know nothing of Virton, except that it is about as far away from anywhere that anything in Belgium can be. It is closer to Luxembourg, France and Germany than it is to Brussels. Rumour suggests it takes about 6 hours drive down dirt tracks to even get to the capital, though many of the locals have never even seen a car and their beer is actually still made by monks.

\[pe2-image src=”http://lh5.ggpht.com/-Yu\_mpheB5oI/Ut5K5rdQ9iI/AAAAAAAAEF4/yHXKgt4uBUc/s144-o/IMG\_4323.jpg” href=”https://picasaweb.google.com/117823912047779151886/Gilloise#5971292510718326306″ caption=”Whitbread? Of course, Whitbread” type=”image” alt=”IMG\_4323.jpg” pe2\_single\_image\_size=”w640″ pe2\_img\_align=”center” \]

However, the whole stupid, championship-winning Virton team had their hair or heads died stupid green to celebrate their stupid title victory. They looked like jade oompa loompas, ref should have booked the lot of them for bringing hairdressing into disrepute. The 13 travelling fans must have been shamed by this open display of horse play, no one wants to see fun in football.

\[pe2-image src=”http://lh4.ggpht.com/-EyXPTBPksjc/Ut5KklvPQkI/AAAAAAAAEEc/sgv8daiUxus/s144-o/294880\_10151678705248974\_858712261\_n.jpg” href=”https://picasaweb.google.com/117823912047779151886/Gilloise#5971292148405846594″ caption=”Disrespectful hair.

As the game got underway there was a nervous, almost resigned air about the place, in a less than encouraging crowd of no more than 500-600. The RUSG Ultras tried a little then went quiet as they went 1-0 down. The young lass next to us had permanently crossed fingers while the old lady in front of her was berating everyone in the ground for a reason that my pigeon French could not fathom.

\[pe2-image src=”http://lh3.ggpht.com/-szORbyTQ0yk/Ut5Ki8JFNwI/AAAAAAAAEEA/\_xbxbr\_PL68/s144-o/182728\_10151678706453974\_736047076\_n.jpg” href=”https://picasaweb.google.com/117823912047779151886/Gilloise#5971292120060081922″ caption=”This did not work. Well, briefly.” type=”image” alt=”182728\_10151678706453974\_736047076\_n.jpg” pe2\_single\_image\_size=”w640″ pe2\_img\_align=”center” \]

Then, a lifeline. A penalty for RUSG thanks to a quite spectacular dive by the right winger. Think Nani. Nerves jangled, the crowd told each other to be quiet for the penalty. Never heard that before, either respectful or superstitious? Union’s keeper, on his knees back at the other end, asked for intervention from a higher force. 1-1! Back in the league. Four minutes later, 1-2 happened and the mundane spectre of relegation returned.

\[pe2-image src=”http://lh5.ggpht.com/-cMy0hgzNik4/Ut5K6OoOExI/AAAAAAAAEF8/OvPTJYDsk84/s144-o/IMG\_4322.jpg” href=”https://picasaweb.google.com/117823912047779151886/Gilloise#5971292520159515410″ caption=”Vociferous septuagenarian” type=”image” alt=”IMG\_4322.jpg” pe2\_single\_image\_size=”w640″ pe2\_img\_align=”center” \]

Half time and a descent down the north face of the Eiger was required to get to the burgers, no better than English grounds, which required a skip past the scoreboard, which was a mobile phone screen set back in the trees. Ring-ring. Let’s be honest, that terrace doesn’t look much from the opposite side of the pitch, it’s awe doesn’t properly hit until you get to the foot of it and have to crane your neck to see the top.

\[pe2-image src=”http://lh6.ggpht.com/-EoJbacSqrdE/Ut5KnEtrbiI/AAAAAAAAEE8/Q04tn9uNB0k/s144-o/944902\_10151678710113974\_75096092\_n.jpg” href=”https://picasaweb.google.com/117823912047779151886/Gilloise#5971292191080541730″ caption=”THIS worked, 1-1!” type=”image” alt=”944902\_10151678710113974\_75096092\_n.jpg” pe2\_single\_image\_size=”w640″ pe2\_img\_align=”center” \]

The second half started off brightly and Union equalised (2-2) and a third looked on the cards for a good 10 minutes after. It was beginning to look like Union might dig themselves out of trouble. The two teams above Union were playing out a 1-1 draw so a win would have meant Union finished outside the relegation places on goal difference.

\[pe2-image src=”http://lh6.ggpht.com/-20t9Nss8Sa4/Ut5KmQEOGDI/AAAAAAAAEEw/3tUomOI7hVE/s144-o/600838\_10151678712418974\_1655189948\_n.jpg” href=”https://picasaweb.google.com/117823912047779151886/Gilloise#5971292176948009010″ caption=”It’s all over, RUSG are down.” type=”image” alt=”600838\_10151678712418974\_1655189948\_n.jpg” pe2\_single\_image\_size=”w640″ pe2\_img\_align=”center” \]

Then came Virton’s third … and fourth. Game over, Union lost 2-4 and their relegation was confirmed. It might have helped if their field-like pitch had been flattened at some point prior to the game. It’s not easy playing tika-taka on such a bumpy and rock hard pitch where the ball rears up at you or bounces sideways every time you go near it.

\[pe2-image src=”http://lh4.ggpht.com/-7fSFEZmKCXs/Ut5KlvGLc1I/AAAAAAAAEEs/86Vyq24So7I/s144-o/480339\_10151678663238974\_39356051\_n.jpg” href=”https://picasaweb.google.com/117823912047779151886/Gilloise#5971292168097854290″ caption=”Soviet Era Supporters Shop, owned by Roy.” type=”image” alt=”480339\_10151678663238974\_39356051\_n.jpg” pe2\_single\_video\_size=”w640″ pe2\_single\_image\_size=”w640″ pe2\_img\_align=”center” \]

But, wait, what’s this? It’s Belgium. Play offs? Oh yes. But, the thing said they were relegated? Yeah, well, that’s what the Internet was saying but, in fact, no, there is a whole mutha of play off shenanigans to consider. OK, below the two 3rd tier leagues there are a four ‘promotion’ leagues. These are not geographically split, just split quite randomly. The champions of those leagues move up into the 3rd tier. The next three teams in each league (12 in total) then go into a round of one-off play off games. The six winners of the first round of play off games then go to a 2nd round of one-off play off games, where they re added to the two team who finished 3rd from bottom in the two 3rd tier leagues! The winners of those four play off games then face a third round of play off games and the winners of those two games are placed in the third tier.

So, having beaten Leopoldsburg on penalties after a 4-4 draw, RUSG now play Sporting Hasselt on 27th May to stay in the 3rd tier. So, the SS-designed ‘supporters shop’ may yet see 3rd tier football again next season. Go. Just go. [Royal Union St Gilloise.](http://www.rusg.be/)
