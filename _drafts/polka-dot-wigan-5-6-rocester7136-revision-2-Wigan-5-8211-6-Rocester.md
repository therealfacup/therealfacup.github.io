<div>Deceased Scottish tragi-poet, [William McGonagall](http://www.mcgonagall-online.org.uk/), reports on the the fearful fever afflicting the Athletics of Wigan, where Beecham first sold his wares.

**Wigan In Need Of Tonic – Beecham’s Pills** **by William McGonagall**

What ho! sickly people of high and low degree  
I pray ye all be warned by me;  
No matter what may be your bodily ills  
The safest and quickest cure is Beecham’s Pills.

They are admitted to be worth a guinea a box  
For bilious and nervous disorders, also smallpox,  
And dizziness and drowsiness, also cold chills,  
And for such diseases nothing else can equal Beecham’s Pills

They have been proved by thousands that have tried them  
So that the people cannot them condemn.  
Be advised by me one and all  
Is the advice of Poet McGonagall.

Take care now, people of Wigan, it will all feel better in the morning, Wigan 5-6 Rocester.
