excerpt: "Manchester City may well still have the ruddy flush of hard-fought victory in their cheeks and be parading 'their' FA Cup around the US of A but for hundreds of non-league sides, the Extra Preliminary Round of the 2011/12 FA Cup starts in but 4 weeks. Don't get your hopes up but one of the team's we're going to see don't do dull cup games ... \n\nCurrent front page features Extra Preliminary games from previous years."

[Socrates Meet Up ](http://www.footballfairground.com/socrates)led the way at Lewes CFC last season with their inaugural bloggers away day and, for the new season, they’ve chosen the tricky first FA Cup weekend of the season for the follow up. Tricky? Yes, it’s also kick off day for the Ryman League and La Liga while many other fans will still be feeling the freshness of a hope-strewn, new season just two weeks old. The promotion push, title win, play off berth and brave relegation escape are all still possible. At least until dashed upon the flotsam-littered shore of a nought-point September (As it happens, the almost predictable dullness of the first Premier League weekend leads us to believe you might bring forward that date to this weekend! – come on down!).

However, if none of those other triflings afflict you, you’ll no doubt want to be heading out on the road, with your tin foil cup, in search of some FA Cup high jinks. Well, how about Colliers Wood? Where? Errr, the A3 between Wimbledon Common and Richmond Park! It has nice pubs, pine freshness and a reasonably priced game of early season Cup football. And, although this missive is partly directed at the many hundreds of bloggers out there, it is also a call to arms to anyone else at a loose end, who lives locally and is in search of something different. And history suggests a potential goal rush.

**Colliers Wood Utd .v. Chessington &amp; Hook Utd – £6 – [Wibbandune Sports Ground](http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=colliers+wood+united&hl=en&ll=51.421289,-0.252004&spn=0.001816,0.004823&sll=53.800651,-4.064941&sspn=14.118794,39.506836&fll=51.421289,-0.252004&fspn=0.001816,0.004823&z=18&iwloc=A)** What more could you want on a summer’s day? **\*prays for sun\*** Colliers Wood have been around in one form or another for over 136 years. You have to wonder what on earth was going on at the club because it took them 132 years to even enter the FA Cup! Did they have a big dog ensconsed at the gate of the ground that preveneted the postman delivering important FA invites? Did the Wood not have a local newsagent so they could hear tales of this wondrous Cup taking the worlde by storme?

When the message finally got through and the old jug was revealed to them, a light seemed to go on! Improved ground facilities followed, a record 9-1 Combined Counties League win was racked up and they then squeezed 151 eager supporters in to break their league attendance record against Guildford City in 2010.

**Goal Fest**  
These rising folk from south west London welcome to their world of adventure the much newer Chessington &amp; Hook Utd. Two separate clubs until 1986, the merged unit have a somewhat frivolous and entertaining attitude to football in Cup matches that could perhaps persuade you to give this game a go. In the 2nd Qualifying round of the FA Vase in 2000, they whacked in 5 \[five\] goals against Arundel, only to concede 8 \[eight\] at the other end. In the last ten years in FA Vase or Cup they’ve also shipped seven, twice shipped six and five and have probably lost count of the four-fers. But, among all that, they have also had the potency to themselves rack up four or five on half a dozen occasions.

If you fancy the game details can be found here at the If you’re a blogger and wish to be part of any ‘organised’ shenangians of the day, just visit our [Facebook Event Page](http://www.facebook.com/home.php#%21/event.php?eid=150711281671456) or write “Please, Mr Socrates, may I run with you in the Wood” @ the [@SocratesMeetUp](http://twitter.com/#%21/SocratesMeetUp) Twitter feed. Actually, you don’t have to say that, just tell them you want to come. The start venue will be [The Hand In Hand](http://www.thehandinhandwimbledon.co.uk/) near Wimbledon Common from midday.

As an added bonus we’re also heading to [Ascot United](http://www.ascotunited.net/newsdtlClub.asp?newsID=2969) on Friday 19th August for their tie with Wembley FC, kick off 7:45. The actual FA Cup will be there too!
