In a recent report one of our guest authors referred to Paulton Rovers v Didcot Town as ‘low level’ football. One of our followers on Twitter, a Miss Molly Coddle, suggested this term was disrespectful. She might be right. In the context of the author being a fan, primarily, of a Championship club it also might be a factually accurate description. In the wider context of the footballing pyramid, two Zamaretto League sides are not particularly low level.

Three different interpretations there and I’m sure there are more.

As I said to Miss Coddle, I find the phrase ‘non league’ a little disparaging because it suggests the football on offer is not up to league standards and, therefore, of lower quality – much like ‘low level’. This could also be factually accurate but I see it as tinged with innuendo, “christ he’s playing like a non-league player”. The irony is that I listen to the BBC Non League show above any other similar league show without batting an eyelid.

In one sense it’s an irrelevant discussion, we’re arguably both being a little sensitive about other people’s terminology on a subject we see as of great value and of no lesser worth than the top level professional ‘product’ (for want of a better word).

In another sense it’s also irrelevant how you choose to describe football in its regional guise because it’s entirely subjective and entirely contextualised by who the author of the description is and where they are coming from. If Brian Woolnough had said ‘low level’, you’d imagine it was probably not a positive comment.

However, on another level it is entirely relevant because the football is important to us and by perceiving someone else’s opinion negatively we feel sleighted and get peeved. I don’t have a particular problem with the term ‘low level’ but I would definitely have said ‘lower level’ and I can see our Twitter friend’s point.

I think it’s important to note that the vast majority of bloggers, like us, do not intend to offend and, quite probably, don’t see the terms in the way that readers do. I know the author and he would have used the term factually and meant nothing negative. Actually, that’s a lie, there are certain teams we’ll happily rip into \*Hello Chelsea\* but they aren’t in non-league.

And, also, if we do offend, fuck you! (Only joking)

Comment up Miss Coddle, what do you think?
