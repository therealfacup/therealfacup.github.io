The lovely Natalie Sawyer was in attendance at the Nanpantan Sports Ground to witness something that would have even got Jim White more excited than a stripper in the Sky Sports Studio, five minutes from the end of Transfer Deadline Day.

With her Brentford side 3-0 up and cruising in an already-enthralling encounter at 8th tier opponents Loughborough Dynamo, and barely a minute left, you’d have thought there was very little reason to stick around any longer. But as exhausted fans were streaming out the ground, a fairly innocuous cross from Sam Saunders met the path of a rather large overhead seagull, swooping down unwittingly, causing one of the most bizarre moments ever seen on a football pitch as it bobbled beyond startled Dynamo goalkeeper Laurie Pearson, and trickled over the line.

Amidst all the laughter and confusion from the remaining travelling Brentford fans, there was much deliberation as to whether the goal should actually stand. The Loughborough players protested as Saunders and co tried their very best to celebrate with dignity, and the local medical staff attended the winded seagull who had been left lying flat out on the pitch. After five minutes discussing with his assistants, referee Trevor Kettle decided to rule in favour of the goal. He later explained his decision; “I wasn’t sure whether to give it at first, as the seagull technically wasn’t part of play. But after five minutes I thought ‘sod it, life’s too short, it’s bloody funny’. And besides, if that beach ball can score up at Sunderland, why can’t a seagull do the same here?”

The day had started with FA Cup fever going around for the hosts from the Northern Premier League Division One South. Literally. An outbreak of flu across the town meant that half the population were struck down with symptoms, including many at the game today and certain members of the playing staff. This led to atmospheric taunts from visiting fans such as “You’re sick, and you know you are” and “Does your Doctor know you’re here?” It was all taken in good humour though, as the 1,000-strong home support wheezed out in unison “Cough your phlegm up for the lads” in response to their more-illustrious and healthy-bodied opponents.

The home side actually began the brighter in front of a capacity crowd, with striker Louis Hamilton firing narrowly wide of Richard Lee’s right-hand post inside five minutes. A bombardment of crosses from Ash Way followed over the next quarter of an hour; the youngster showing ability far beyond what would be expected at this level, using pace and movement to leave the League One side baffled as to how to deal with him. Brentford, on the other hand, were reduced to a series of very hopeful long-range efforts; Jonathon Douglas coming closest, but still some way over the bar.

That all changed however on 33 minutes, when, after being in control of the opening proceedings, Dynamo Captain Karl Noble suffered a sudden head-rush, lunging in two-footed on Toumani Diagouraga, in what was a seemingly tepid situation in the middle of the park. Noble received a straight red for his actions, causing a wave of exasperated coughing and spluttering all around (quite possibly infecting everybody else present with the flu), and whilst he protested his innocence, he was eventually escorted off the pitch by Loughborough’s assistant, Scott Machin. Frenchman Diagouraga was also escorted off the pitch, on a stretcher with a suspected broken ankle. Myles Weston came on in his place.

Down to 10 men, the part-timers went from potential giant-killers, to simply hoping to gain a money-spinning replay at Griffin Park. Despite holding out valiantly for the next ten minutes, that aim began to look increasingly less likely when Clayton Donaldson weaved through the Dynamo defence, and took the opportunity to delightfully chip the ball over goalkeeper Pearson from the edge of the area, sending Mrs Sam Matterface and 500 other Brentford fans into raptures just before the break. It most definitely would have been goal of the game but for the madness that ensued later on.

After the half-time refreshments of soup and lemsip, and recovering from the disappointment of going a goal down, the crowd found their voices again and got croaking for the start of the second half. Much like the first, the hosts began with intent; Matt Langham struck the bar with a thunderous strike from 18 yards out, only for the rebound to fall to centre-back Danny Gibbons, who provided a real “defenders’ finish” to proceedings by shanking it out the ground and into the pastures behind it. It may have hit a cow on its way down, but we’re not sure.

On 52 minutes, The Moes, as they are affectionately nicknamed, were gifted a dream opportunity to draw level. Shaleum Logan sold his back-pass short to goalkeeper Richard Lee, leaving Louis Hamilton to burst through one-on-one. Lee chopped down his opponent on the edge of the area and rightly saw the second straight red of the match. Penalty to Loughborough, and the numbers were now even.

Maybe the numbers on the pitch were even, but on the scoreboard… or whatever instrument was keeping score, they were determined not to be. Substitute goalkeeper Simon Moore replaced Harlee Dean and his first touch was to take the ball out the back of the… stand. Dan Henton, in his attempts to ensure Moore couldn’t save the penalty, hammered the ball as hard as he could, but unfortunately forgot about accuracy as it sailed a good five yards wide of the ‘keepers left-hand post, hitting a fan square in the face. Fortunate for Moore, as he’d gone the other way. Unfortunate for the poor Loughborough fan though, who’d not only seen his team miss a golden chance, but he’ll have to shell out another £90 at Specsavers on Monday morning to replace those broken glasses.

We all know that football is a game of taking your chances when you get them, and that was demonstrated in textbook fashion (who’s writing all these textbooks on football anyway?) when, straight from the goal kick, Adam Forshaw was pinned down in the Loughborough box by Carl Sibson, and another penalty was awarded. Clayton Donaldson stepped up, and coolly slotted his second of the game into the bottom-far corner, beyond ‘keeper Pearson’s reach. 53 minutes in, and it was looking like game over for the part-timers

**Dynamo. Not a fan of either team, and has nothing to do with this match whatsoever, but y’know… Loughborough Dynamo? The magic of the Cup…? Yeah? Never mind.**

Despite having fallen 2-0 behind, the hosts simply did not give up. With numerical parity on the park and very little to lose now, they sought about pushing the League One side further and further back, but without Karl Noble pulling the strings, there was very little penetration and the match descended into a sluggish midfield slog for the next five minutes. Manager Scott Clamp continued to bark orders at his troops, but with fitness levels beginning to show and approaching the hour mark, changes were in order.

He decided to roll the dice and make three changes at once. One of them, Dave Blenkinsopp, who had replaced Louis Hamilton up front, made an instant impact by forcing Simon Moore into a sprawling dive in order to prevent being beaten from 25 yards. From the resulting corner, Danny Gibbons’ second attempt on goal proved marginally better than his first earlier on, as his header sailed just over the bar.

Uwe Rösler also decided on making his remaining change. The former Manchester City player took off Adam Forshaw in order to plug the gap at the back left by the sending-off, sending on young Alfie Mawson for his first taste of competitive first-team action with 30 minutes left.

Dynamo’s fate was sealed on 72 minutes. As they continued to attack, Leon Legge took hold of the ball and pumped it up to Clayton Donaldson. Already on two goals, Donaldson set about his hat-trick by turning 35 yards from goal and making a break for it, but was foiled by an excellent last-ditch tackle from Jake Betts. However, regrettably for Betts and Loughborough, the ball landed straight at the feet of Myles Weston, who only had to stroke it beyond Laurie Pearson from no more than 6 yards. A harsh killer goal on the break, but that’s the nature of football, and the professionals were certainly showing their status by making these chances count.

That took the atmosphere out the game. Many home fans were content to trawl back home and take a well-deserved sleep, whilst the Brentford supporters were more afraid of catching germs than their team falling foul to an embarrassing early cup shock. Carl Sibson received a second yellow card to complete the trio of dismissals in the game on 86 minutes, and the match was threatening to bumble out into anonymity for the remaining five or six minutes, after what had been an utterly draining contest.

However, there was one last and rather large splodge of lunacy to top this game off. It should be taken into account that regardless of the probability of a seagull (or any bird, for that matter) swooping down at the precise moment a football is heading its way and managing to score a goal; the nearest coastline to Loughborough is over 70 miles away, so what it was doing there is anyone’s guess. Nobody can quite explain why a bird traditionally associated with the coast ended up that far inland – but this isn’t an episode of Countryfile, is it?

Under normal circumstances, Saunders’ cross should have been heading comfortably into the arms of the goalkeeper. In fact, it definitely would have been but for his fright of seeing a giant seagull heading towards him. The diving flight of the bird distressed Laurie Pearson so much that he covered his face and crouched behind his near-post in an attempt to avoid it, but in doing so, conceded surely what has to have been one of the most embarrassing goals ever known as it ambled meekly into the far corner of the net. It is thought the bird noticed a young boy with a bag of chips behind the goal, and in meaning to swoop for his delicious prey, ended up on the score sheet in an FA Cup match. Who said junk food can’t help you achieve sporting success?  
After the match, Scott Clamp declared how proud he was of his players, but claimed something out there was determined not to see his team succeed today:

“We’ve had a number of the team struck down with flu”, he stated, “Tie that in with red cards, a missed penalty and allowing seagulls to score for them, there was just something in the aether trying to ensure we didn’t stand a chance today. But needless to say, I’m still extremely proud of how we went about our business, and we certainly didn’t deserve to lose by four”. When asked about the ‘sea-goal’, he simply uttered “It shouldn’t have stood”.

**Brentford’s new wing-er: Not necessarily the one that scored, so just a random picture of a seagull really, but still. Scary-looking thing, isn’t it? Imagine that flying towards you at high velocity.**

Brentford manager Uwe Rösler was decidedly more jovial in his post-match interview. “It’s the magic of the FA Cup!” he exclaimed, “I must admit, that’s better finishing than I’ve seen from most of our strikers in training!” When asked whether he was going to consider signing the bird, he quipped, “Surely he should sign for Brighton, shouldn’t he?”

It must be made known that, for those of you concerned; the seagull is absolutely fine after his traumatic experience. Queens Park Rangers are said to be interested in securing his services.

**Ratings:**

**Brentford:** Lee (3) (Sent off 52); Logan (6), Dean (6) (Moore (6) 52), Legge (7), Craig (6); Saunders (7), Forshaw (6) (Mawson (6) 63), O’Connor (7), Douglas (7), Diagouraga (5) (Weston (7) 33); Donaldson (9). Seagull (10). Subs not used: Forrester, Reeves, El Alagui, German.

**Attendance:** 1,578 (501 from Brentford)  
**Man of the Match:** Clayton Donaldson (Brentford)  
It says man of the match, not creature. But seriously, Donaldson played the lone striker role to perfection today and would surely have grabbed the headlines with his brace had it not been for the sheer insanity of those final few minutes. His opener was the kind of goal we’d all be spellbound with if Lionel Messi had scored it. That’s the only time you’re likely to read that comparison, enjoy it.

Disclaimer: No seagulls (or cows) were hurt in the making of this match report, but I believe that guy is gutted about his glasses. And if you’re travelling to Loughborough anytime soon, don’t be put off; half the town hasn’t actually got the flu. By the way, Mr. Diagouraga, if you’re reading this… get well soon.
