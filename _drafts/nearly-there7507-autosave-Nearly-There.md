Memories, are made of this. Of our five remaining level nine underdogs, three are in the hat for the 4<sup>th</sup> Qualifying Round. One of them only by dint of a replay being required but South Park and Blackfield &amp; Langley can now dare to dream, either of a meaty, money-spinning clash with Luton Town (not often you see that phrase but it’s all relative) or whether they hope for an easier game and try for a spot in the ‘propers’ – and then draw Luton Town.

And in that sentence you see how the opening up of the football pyramid has changed the dynamic of the FA Cup. Back in the day when the league was a closed shop, all non-league sides had to do was set up their stall to get past the final qualifying round (is that all!?) for the chance to play a league club. In an age where maximising revenue is as (if not more) important as how far you get, the prize of a league team is perhaps more difficult to attain but the silver medal of a tie against a fallen league team in 4Q is significantly more likely.

In the 4<sup>th</sup> Qualifying Round the BSB Premier sides enter into the fray and, currently, in that league there are a handful of sides who have been in the Championship in actual living memory (Luton, Grimsby, Stockport and Cambridge) and several others who would be considered big if you’d drawn them in Round 1 at some stage in the last 20 years. So, a prize is available sooner to lower non-league teams even if they don’t get to the propers. But, that place in Round 1 of the FA Cup is still the holy grail. As a team, that means you’ve arrived, you’ve had a good year, people will remember you.

Tadcaster Albion and Badshot Lea will, unfortunately, have to wait another year for a shot at either prize. The former were always going to be up against it, giving away a huge pyramid deficit to the former league club, Boston United. The latter were also likely to have insufficient means to conquer Chippenham Town but, as Redbridge proved last season, it is not impossible. The fact they were away from home probably didn’t help

**Tadcaster Albion 0-2 Boston United  
Chippenham Town 3-1 Badshot Lea**

But, in the hat with the ‘giants’ listed above and the fallen/risen ‘name’ clubs of Newport, Wrexham, Hereford and Mansfield are three sides who are currently on their best ever cup runs. Never before have Dereham Town, Blackfield &amp; Langley or South Park got to the 3<sup>rd</sup> Qualifying Round. Dereham Town may not yet make it past that stage, their 1-1 draw at home with Met Police now means they are very much favourites to go out. So, come on Dereham!

South Park and Blackfield &amp; Langley, however, have been sitting back, waiting for the draw and pondering who they want to get? Are they hoping for an innocuous draw against a beatable side a tier above them? Or are they hoping for that big pay day? To put it in context though, whichever Premier League side wins the trophy this season, they will have to win as many games as these two sides have already won. So, this draw, as odd as it may seem, is effectively the final for these two. If either of them wins the final, they will be short-odds favourites to win this year’s Real FA Cup draw for greatest achievement a Blue Square North or South side will have to get to the 3<sup>rd</sup> Round to challenge them.

As it happens … here’s how the draw panned out … Dereham Town falling in their replay.

**South Park .v. Met Police**

 **Hastings Utd .v. Blackfield &amp; Langley**
