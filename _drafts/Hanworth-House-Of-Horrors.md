**FA Cup 3rd Qualifying Round 2011/12**

It’s the FA Cup 3rd Qualifying round. A beautiful autumn day and the biggest crowd so far this season at Beaconsfield, Sloughs temporary home.

Hanworth Villa are the visitors, arriving in numbers and fine voice with two full coaches. They’ve bought more away support than the rest of our league put together!

Slough and Hanworth have never met before and the ‘Villains’ who are based near Feltham in Middlesex, only formed in 1976 and have risen up the pyramid moving into their current ground in 1997. ‘The Ranch’ has slowly been developed enough for Hanworth to enter the FA Cup for their first time this season.

Playing a league below Slough in the Combined Counties they average 125 for league games and a lot of their players started at the club as teenagers. But it’s more than just a football club. With the decline in the number of pubs, social clubs and meeting places available for people locally ‘The Ranch’ is bucking this trend with the club house open 7 days a week, and employing a full time manager.

But Hanworth battled back and roared on by their voracious support they equalised in the 37th minute.

In the second half events off the pitch started to turn ugly. The majority of their away support, decided not to bother with the non league ritual of swapping ends. We traded chants then Sloughs Paul Coyne scored after a defensive mix up. On 67 minutes Hanworths Levi King scored an absolute screamer from a 25 yard free kick. 2 each.

The Hanworth fans celebrated by barging into Slough supporters and intimidating them, then racist and homophobic chants, abuse of disabled supporters, running on the pitch and, of course, everyone in Slough is a Muslim (no blackberry jokes tho). Out came those old seventies classics like ‘you’re going home in a f\*\*\*\*ing ambulance’ and ‘you’re gonna get your f\*\*\*ing head kicked in’.

Hello, this is non league football not some re-run of a football crowd scene from ‘Life On Mars’.

If Slough had scored I think we could all predict what would have happened next. As it was this was the first time in over 10 years that the police have had to be called to a Slough game and this was solely due to the Hanworth fans. The crowd of 525, many no doubt visiting for the first time, wouldn’t have come away with very good impressions of non league football.

As it was a draw was a fair result with the replay this Tuesday. It’s a shame that already quite a few Slough fans say that this is one game they won’t be going too.
