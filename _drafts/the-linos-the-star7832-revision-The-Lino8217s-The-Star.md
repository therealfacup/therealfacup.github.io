If you go to a football match in or around London you’re never far away from an airport or the sight of a plane. Often you can just hear a distant hum and see the gentle altitude reduction of each cylinder of people returning from, or arriving at, their holiday destination. There are closer grounds to airports than Bishop’s Stortford’s Woodside Park stadium is to Stansted but few where you can practically see where the plane has come from and its elongated battle with gravity.

These sights are usually an occasional intrusion on the fayre but for the first hour at Woodside Park yesterday, they were the highlight. The tick-tock of a Ryanair or easyJet punctuated by the exciting chime of an enormous FedEx freight plane.

But, before all that, the long walk through well-to-do suburbia from Stortford train station out to the ground is punctuated only by the [Nag’s Head](http://www.stortfordhistory.co.uk/guide10/brooke_gardens.html). That name brings to mind a knackered old boozer liberally sprinkled with gap-toothed old men poring over the Racing Post. The Stortford Nag is a purpose built (and lovingly restored) art-deco wonder of a pub, where the modern feel inside is tempered by the style of the 30s. This type of place can often feel sterile but, when you realise it was actually built as a pub, it makes a lot more sense and the modernity gives way, mostly, to aesthetic pleasure.

After last week’s 6-0 home defeat the \[cliche alert\] “hardy” dozen or so travelling fans probably weren’t expecting to add to the season’s tally of 13 points. But, given Stortford had at the same time only managed a 1-1 draw at Hinckley, the only club in the league below The Bloods, perhaps they sensed hope.

Dresden, as [@mattbison](https://twitter.com/mattbison) had quickly dubbed the away side, started lively, Jeff, with Stefan Cox proving difficult to follow. But the half quickly petered out into a bitty, stop-start affair with almost no action in either box. A nasty mustard-on-sleeve catering incident and the relentless descent of air traffic the only things of note on the coldest day ever in Bishop’s Stortford. With hindsight, the lack of action a blessing with the finger/tweet/cold threshold being about 30 seconds.

OK, it was arctic and it was 17th against 21st but the 298 attendance would have been disappointing at Champion Hill, let alone two tiers higher in the Blue Square North. That said, those who hadn’t bothered to come must have known something, this was as poor a first half of football as you’re likely to see.

So, half time, 0-0 and our progress to the warm bar was halted as a steward was distracted from opening the gates until he’d dealt with an angry and ageing Barry Shitpeas, who was pointing aggressively and muttering at some old men sitting high up in the Stortford main stand. No one wants to see aggressive pointing in football.

As the Droylsden official made a spectacle of himself, the dozen hardy souls from up Manchester way were making a much better impression in the cosy bar. The Real FA Cup posse pondered their team’s half time scores and if horses were just fast cows. They are. And similarly tasty.

The second half ambled on in much the same way as the first. My prediction of 1-0 either way thanks to a mistake seemed to be on until about 15 minutes in when the home side actually started playing some football and went close with three or four consecutive post-scrapers. Finally, the dull predictably of the Airbus A319 and Boeing 737 had given way to the McDonnell Douglas MD-11 of total football. ‘The tortured inaccuracy of the crow-barred analogy’, sounds like a Morrissey lyric, don’t you think?

“A goal’s coming, but which way?”, I said, the only person to bother verbalising the stunning obviousness of what was about to happen. Dresden emerged from their half for the first time in 15 minutes, got a free kick 25 yards out and Logan promptly buried a grass-cutting free kick under the wall and into the corner.

The barely deserved lead lasted for just 7 minutes. A Stortford midfielder was chopped down a few yards inside the edge of the box. Standing on the sidelines on the same side of the pitch we got a great view of it, as did the lino who waved his flag immediately as the Stortford players appealed. The ref’s view seemed to be obscured and he waved play on until what seemed like an eternity later he noticed the raised flag.

The Dresden centre backs were livid, as were the bench. The Bloods manager was sent to the stands and Barry Shitpeas spent the rest of the game frothing at the mouth whenever the linesman came near him. But Stortford equalised from the spot.

A short corner from the home side a few minutes later encouraged two of therealfacup pundits to bemoan the pointlessness of the short corner: the inevitability of the recipient being pegged back or the subsequent cross being blocked as the defender has extra time to encroach. Obviously, the cross wasn’t blocked. Obviously, the cross wasn’t cleared. And, obviously, the ball was poked home by a centre half. Stortford 2-1 up. What do we know?

The dismal first hour was nearly forgotten in an entertaining last 30 minutes and the home side saw the game out while Barry Shitpeas waited near the tunnel to continue his frothing. The stand out performances of the day were the Droylsden dozen and the near side lino. The fans sang themselves hoarse all afternoon in good humour and in the face of some grim football and weather. The lino helped the ref out on numerous occasions, was spot on for the penalty and had as good a game as we had collectively seen by an official.

The mundanity of the landing planes faded, Stortford climbed to 16th with fans still dreaming of an unlikely play-off berth. Droylsden look forward to Tuesday’s battle of the bottom two knowing it is probably their last chance to kick start what would be an unlikely run to claw back the 15 points between them and the dreaded dotted line.
