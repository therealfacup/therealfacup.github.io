**FA Cup 1st Qualifying Round 2014/15**

FA Cup new boys Ellistown and Ibstock United turned around a two goal half time deficit and their keeper Aaron Harris saved a last minute penalty to overcome their more illustrious opponents Hereford United by three goals to two to continue their inaugural FA Cup adventure.

Other FA Cup first timers still dreaming of meeting the ‘big boys’ are Cleethorpes Town, FC Romania and Northampton Sileby Rangers, who are yet to play their 1st Qualifying Round match after seeing their Preliminary Round victors, AFC Kempston Rovers, removed from the competition.

Dan Rapley scored a last gasp extra time winner for Flackwell Heath in their replay at Wantage Town that sees the club progress through not one, but two rounds in one go owing to the removal of Salisbury City from the competition, giving the Buckinghamshire club a bye to the 3rd Qualifying Round.

There were some high scorers on display with Uxbridge and Tonbridge Angels both netting six, King’s Lynn Town finding the net seven times, and Maidstone United putting ten goals passed Littlehampton Town without reply.

Several clubs can console themselves that despite exiting the competition they have set a new standard for the club. Bowers &amp; Pitsea, Holwell Sports, Longwell Green Sports, Milton United and West Allotment Celtic all reached the 1st Qualifying Round for the first time in their histories, alongside Bradford Town and Brightlingsea Regent who had both only ever experienced Extra Preliminary Round defeats up till now.

Biggleswade United, Chessington &amp; Hook United, Hadleigh United, Horndean, London Colney and Wantage Town all equalled their best ever FA Cup performance, whilst Newmarket Town registered their best round reached since 2004 and Saltash United have never been further in 22 years. On the flip side it has been Hereford United’s worst FA Cup performance since 1946, AFC Hornchurch equalled their worst ever run and Redditch United has never done any worse this century.

Horndean and Redditch United have both been eliminated at the 1st Qualifying Round stage for each of the last four seasons, with Chesham United, Littlehampton Town and Nantwich Town all making it three years in a row with a Q1 exit. Both representatives from Ossett bowed at this stage for the first time in three years, whilst Biggleswade United’s defeat to Leverstock Green means that we will have to wait another year at least before both that town’s clubs appear in the 2nd Qualifying Round in the same season.  
On a final note, Cartman and Kenny will be suffering as members of South Park were beaten by the police, the Metropolitan Police that is, by three goals to nil!
