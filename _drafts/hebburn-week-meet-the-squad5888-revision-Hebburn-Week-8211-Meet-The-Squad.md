The Northern League Division Two side will take on professional outfit Gateshead this Saturday at the International Stadium and, [after finding out where the team came from](http://therealfacup.co.uk/2011/10/22/mr-hebburn-alphonse-to-you/), today Dean Nicholson, one of Hebburn’s FA Cup heroes, introduces us to the names that will be hoping to be headline makers this weekend.

Dean, 23-years old and an office worker for Orange, joined Hebburn last season and has professional experience with West Bromwich Albion and BostonUnited, as well as seeing non-league action with Workington Town. The midfielder will be a danger with his set-piece delivery and all-action style.

*GOALKEEPER*  
**Dan Regan** (pictured right): Signed from Washington at the start of this season. A great shot stopper and a fantastic kicker of the ball.

*DEFENDERS*  
**Jeff Forsyth**: Former West Bromwich Albion professional. Very tenacious, good in the air and loves a stepover.  
**John Toomey**: Fantastic in the air and signed from Ryhope last year having previously been at Sunderland. He’s the clown of the dressing room.  
**[![](http://delta.xssl.net/~sbarnett/therealfacup/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Jewels1-200x216.jpg "Jewels")](http://therealfacup.co.uk/2011/10/26/hebburn-week-meet-the-squad/jewels1/)Lee Harrison**: Signed from Chester-le-Street during pre-season and is previously of Sunderland. He’s got an excellent left foot and has settled in very well during the early stages of this season.  
**Chris Jewels** (left): Came in from Ashington and has made a excellent start. He’s the captain of the side and an excellent, all-round player.  
**Stu Wright**: Signed from Newcastle Benfield during the summer. An excellent player who is comfortable at the back or in midfield. He’s very quick and has a sweet left foot.

*MIDFIELDERS*  
**Dean Walker**: A young lad who’s very quick and delivers a great ball.  
**Jamie McClen** (pictured below right): Don’t need to say much about Jamie. He’s an ex-Newcastle United player who keeps us ticking.  
**Dean Nicholson**: I’ll let you say the rest, Andy! (See above).[![](http://delta.xssl.net/~sbarnett/therealfacup/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/McClen-courtesy-Shields-Gazette-200x142.jpg "McClen courtesy Shields Gazette")](http://therealfacup.co.uk/2011/10/26/hebburn-week-meet-the-squad/mcclen-courtesy-shields-gazette/)  
**Chris Tait**: A goal-scoring midfielder who signed from Birtley Town during the summer. He’s settled in very well and scored a lot of goals so far.  
**Paul Gardiner**: Signed from West Allotment Celtic during the summer. He’s an ex-Carlisle United player and an excellent technical player. Another of our goal scoring midfielders and he scored twice against Radcliffe.  
**Paul King**: Just got back from a summer in Greece; has an excellent engine and is good with both feet. Paul made his debut against Radcliffe.  
**Scott Bamborough**: Signed from Bishop Auckland and has made a good start at the club. He’s very strong and good with both feet.

**Stephen Forster**: Ex-Birmingham City player; a very young and lively forward who’s capable of scoring goals in any team.  
**Tony Stephenson**: Tony has been in great form this season and would be a thorn in the side of any defence. The ex-Gillingham player is quick, direct and a has a great left foot  
**Liam McBryde** (left): Top goal scorer this season for us. He’s an ex-Sunderland player who’s excellent both in the air and on thefloor. He’s the main striking option we have.[  ](http://therealfacup.co.uk/2011/10/26/hebburn-week-meet-the-squad/liam-mcbryde1/)**ChrisLunn**: Signed from West Auckland during the summer. He’s a very quick and direct player. We don’t quite know what he will do next … and neither does he!  
**Stu Nicholson** (below right): Started at West Bromwich Albion and has played for several professional clubs. Stu has recently returned from a spell playing in Australia. Very quick and direct and he’s absolutely deadly in front of goal.

They are: Ben Miley, Jak Wells, Chris Bannon, Martin Hunter, Clayton Davison and Paul Hutchinson.
