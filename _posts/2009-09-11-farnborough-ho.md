therealfacup were hoping to build on the massive SIX followers who came with us to a festival of football and wasps at Dulwich in the last round. Typically, just as the momentum builds, it seems we’ve been split into two factions thanks to prior engagements. One faction is heading west to Farnborough .v. Hastings Utd, the other south to Horsham YMCA .v. East Grinstead Town.
