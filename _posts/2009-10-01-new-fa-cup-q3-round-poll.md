Here we go again! This vote seems to have come round very quickly. Anyway, like we said, we’re spreading our wings a little in this round. We could well end up somewhere in the home counties or the Garden of England etc etc

There are some literally HUGE games oop north with several top-of-the-table clashes concerning Blue Square North teams. But we aint going that far just yet. So, we’ve concentrated on the south, the quaint old grounds, the local derbies or the potential giant killings.

\[poll id=”8″\] Click through to the main article for preview of these games.

First up, Oxford City of the Southern Lge Prem take on a team lurking at the top end of the league below, could be the potential for a small shock here.

Next up, Unibond 1 South League side Lincoln United find themslves on a good cup run but they have yet to win a game in the league and they face a stern test from Frickley Athletic in the league above them. When we say Frickley are 2nd from bottom of the league above you might perhaps think the task isn’t as big, however, if you ignore the rather disasterous Durham at the foot of the table with 0 points, the entire league is separated by just 9 points after 10 or 11 games.

Dartford v Chelmsford is quite probably the pundit’s choice in the south. Chelmsford are a Blue Square South club with ambition, they narrowly missed out on promotion last season and are up there again this. Chelmsford also thrashed realfacup favourites Enfield 1893 on their own patch in the previous round. Dartford, though, are roaring clear at the top of the Ryman Premier, just a league below Chelmsford and home advantage will give them heart. This could be a cracking game and, at this stage, either side look good to provide a stern test to league sides in the propers.

Another side storming their respective league, having done so in the previous two seasons also, is Dover. They haven’t had things quite so much their own way this season but are still a fair way ahead of league rivals Welling. Welling have a decent cup pedigree over the last 20 years for a side who were only started up in the 60s. This is probably the pick of the Southern ties, as far as league position goes, but given Dover’s last round victory of 8-0, Welling do have a job on their hands.

Next is derby time. Aylesbury FC and Chesham Utd are only 5-10kms apart but they are separated by two league levels and a whole world in footballing terms. Home advantage should even this out a little for Aylesbury, about whom we were perhaps wrongly a bit harsh in the previous round, where they proved us entirely wrong with a replay victory over the apparently more gifted Wingate &amp; Finchley. Maybe we’ll be following them again?

Finally, perhaps an odd choice, but Thurrock deserve this because there are only two teams left in the draw who are higher up the pyramid. Potters Bar town are two rungs down so we’ve gone for this as a potential upset, partly because of Potters Bar’s convincing win in the previous round.

So, now the choice is yours, tell us where to go, tell us where to get off …
