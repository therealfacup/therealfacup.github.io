*“Often, people leave a legacy of work that survives and endures in the eyes, ears and hearts of all people. Few people are remembered as much for who they were as the body of work they left. Sir Bob’s ethics were not born of football, they were innate, but by osmosis they imbued his Ipswich Town teams with a fundamental ethos of fairness, courage and loyalty. That ethos seeped into the fabric of the club and created a perception of it, of its’ teams and of its’ fans. That perception was realised in a neutral endearment for Ipswich Town that lasted generations. That there has been an erosion of that endearment in recent years makes more acute the absence of the man, his legacy and his inspirational courage. Sir Bob.”*

I once wrote that about Sir Bobby and this eulogy may explain why, in a surprising act of clarity, the FA chose Sir Bobby’s name, memory and legacy to attach to its National Football Day on Saturday August 10th, as part of its 150th anniversary celebrations.

While no obvious links are to be found between Sir Bobby and our local hobbyhorse, Dulwich Hamlet, I am a fan of both, not to mention Sir Bob’s old team Ipswich Town, so it seems fitting to mention the man and the day in pre-amble for the big kick off.

Ipswich’s fellow Suffolkians and bookies favourite Lowestoft Town visit Champion Hill this Saturday giving Hamlet as tough a start to Premier League life as they could get.

**WE PROMISE THIS WILL BE THE ONLY DULWICH HAMLET THING FOR A WHILE**

So, how will Hamlet fare?

The two recent meetings between the sides were both at Crown Meadow, the home side winning last year’s pre-season friendly 2-0 and a cup match the previous December just 1-0. Both of the games were during Lowestoft’s resurgence which has seen them narrowly miss out on promotion to the Conference South in each of the last three seasons, losing play-off finalists at each attempt.

\[pe2-image src=”http://lh3.ggpht.com/-qvQfVckVC50/UgUfpVOkEqI/AAAAAAAACzo/UekcmCWaoH4/s144-o/IMG\_9890.JPG” href=”https://picasaweb.google.com/realfacup/ServiceFile#5910164880926970530″ caption=”” type=”image” alt=”IMG\_9890.JPG” pe2\_single\_image\_size=”s640″ pe2\_single\_image\_size\_format=”P” \]

Though Lowestoft are a strong side with a good deal of pro experience, striker Chris Henderson admitted to the Lowestoft Journal last week that it was against the struggling teams that Lowestoft tended to drop points. Although Hamlet aren’t (yet) strugglers, they are likely to be viewed as easier fodder merely due to being the new boys but, encouragingly, last season Lowestoft won only 3 of 8 games against the promoted sides. Expect a tough game though.

Conversely, Hamlet’s fans don’t really know what to expect. We’ve heard views across the spectrum, from just avoiding relegation to a hope that a technically gifted and settled side could cause some upsets and challenge towards the play off spots. What is certain is that Tuesday night’s 4-1 home defeat to a very strong Premier League Crystal Palace side would have given cause for optimism. While Palace were clearly the better side, Hamlet’s first half defending was solid and they caused the Palace defence a few problems with their movement and tenacity, exemplified in the opportunism of their only goal.

The surprise element of Danny Carr may be gone but in Clunis, Oztumer, Green, James, Vines and Ottaway Hamlet do have the potential to score a few goals at this level. Last season’s cup victories over Kingstonian and Wealdstone and taking Concord to the wire in the Cup Final must give confidence to fans and players alike that they won’t just be making up the numbers.

In reality, the first day of the season is a void of knowledge and form so who knows how this game will pan out. Either way, there should be a good crowd and we’ll be there.

For Lowestoft fans unable to make the LONG journey to Champion Hill, nearby Gorleston are holding [an event](http://www.lowestofttownfc.co.uk/news/the-bobby-robson-national-football-day-at-emerald-park-1008590.html) for Sir Bobby Robson National Football Day.
