Poll winners this time are our local side Dulwich Hamlet. A very short poll window this time meant very few votes, we’ll try to make it longer next time.

In the course of the next few days we’ll hopefully have some interviews from each side, a preview of the round and details for the day. If you want to join us, drop us a line, but we’ll almost certainly be pre-match-ing at The Vale in East Dulwich.
