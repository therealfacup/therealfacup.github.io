It’ll be winter, New Year in fact, we’ll be freeeezing. You folk have chosen to send us off to the north with a virst glass dicket do dottingham.

Notts County have had an eventful season. First they got bought by some billionaires from somewhere. Then Sven rocked up as ‘Director of football’. Then they signed Kasper Schmeichel from Man City. Then they signed England international Sulzeer Campbell. Then Sol didn’t fancy it and nicked off. Then their billionaires (Qadbak) were possibly not fit and proper persons and hid. Then manager McParland was sacked for only being 4th and Sven’s mate Backe turned up to manage the side. Then Qadbak did a runner and Mr Trembling bought the club for £1. That is the last 4 months in a nutshell.

Forest Green? All I know is they’ve been flirting with relegation from the Blue Square Premier for the last few years. Other than that, no idea so I am off to do some research …

Well, it seems they are continuing their flirtation with relegation. Actually, I knew that, I was just emphasising the underdog status they have here. No one will be expecting them to win. In some way though, with Qadbak gone and expectations lowered, some of the pressure is off Notts so it will be harder than perhaps it might have been when the draw was made. But, because Forest Green have won as many FA Cup games as they have league games this season, they should not be underestimated in this competition. That said, they have beaten only one team above them in the league.

They will also have to do without Bristol Rovers loanee Sean Rigg who went back to his parent club and then off on loan higher up the food chain after scoring 7 goals for Green. He was their only real goal threat and without him they are going to struggle.

Last season was the first time they had got to the third round of the FA Cup but they only narrowly lost to Derby. Players that the higher league fan might recognise are Craig Rocastle (Sheff Weds, Oldham), David Brown (Hereford, Hull) and they have just been joined by experienced journeyman Isaiah Rankin, he is probably unavailable though.

The game itself is on Sunday 3rd January at 3pm and is not all ticket, those tickets are £15 and can be purchased on the gate. therealfacup is sending its best men. More info later …

And that badge is just like Barcelona’s, innit?
