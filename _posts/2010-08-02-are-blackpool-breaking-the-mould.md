Or are they simply out of their depth?

Three months on, the bemusement on the faces of Blackpool fans, as they streamed, gob-smacked out of Wembley like the living dead with rictus grins, has turned to concern. With under two weeks to go until the big kick off their squad is the same, in fact it’s worse because their loan players have gone back to daddy.

As it stands, the Blackpool squad is deemed insufficient for top flight purposes. It’s a realistic assumption but it is not out of the question that players without such experience can step up – Ipswich managed it at the turn of the millenium, to a certain extent, as did Reading and maybe even Wigan.

Those clubs, however, were either already bigger than Blackpool or had rich benefactors. And they all added one or two players of quality. Blackpool have, as yet, added none. Not only have they added none but their targets have been, well, not obvious players of quality and those that have been targeted have rejected them. The assumption is that Blackpool are not willing to break their wage structure.

To some pundits this seems folly and they’re probably right. But, really, Blackpool are stuck between a rock and the Premier League. Like so many ‘smaller’ clubs before them (hello League 2 Bradford) they could pay some mercenaries large and long contracts and find themselves like, err, Bradford. Or they can cut their cloth accordingly and cross their fingers, arms, legs, livers, lungs and eyes and hope. Dear hope.

Should we shake our heads and accuse Blackpool of short-sightedeness at not playing the Premier League game of football club roulette? Or should we praise them for bucking the trend and not getting involved in the kamikaze world of Premier League survival?

There is a litany of smaller clubs with big ideas, across Europe, who have tried to swagger in to the saloon loaded with big ideas and a massive overdraft only to be thrown out, destitute, with their pants down and a small but loyal group of fans distraught.

Blackpool simply do not have the fan base or infrastructure to sustain a Premier League team and it will take them more than one year to rebuild what was there in the 50s and before. Similar sized Wigan’s debt continues to grow and, while they have a benefactor, it’s fine. But, after that, what happens? There is no logical reason why Blackpool must follow the debt or benefactor route and it should not preclude them from being in the Premier League. Nor should they be criticised for trying to survive on their own terms.

We say good luck to them, we know they’ll need it.
