A big sorry to optajoe on Twitter, top, top Tweeter that he is (and we are still big suckers for piles of beautifully thought-out stats) but I think the likes of OPTA and Prozone are killing football. These analytical tools are strangling the life out of a game that is, in part, beautiful because of its unpredictable artistry and invention. Passages of play are analysed, particularly by Prozone, so that at the press of ‘RETURN’, any Tom, Dick or Big Sam can get a full mapping of the average game plan of any decent team. Every pass, run, move, dribble, shot is logged, analysed and then nullified by a program that, by usage rather than design, is set out to stop rather than create. OK, quality defending can be beautiful but this data could be used to create, couldn’t it? But how often is it? This method of analysis essentially mechanises a player’s reactive thought process and demystifies the artistry of genuinely more gifted players. Only the most supremely gifted footballers can overcome the negativity.

When enough teams use the method you end up with a very turgid league, what you end up with is 12-14 similarly talented teams where the difference between them is decided by how well they interpret and use the data available. This is, arguably, why the Premier League can be so very, very dull. You may have an above average midfielder, able to play a cut-throat ball 75% of the time but who the opposition have analysed so they prevent that ball by positioning the central defender, at the point of release, 5 yards off the forward and closer to his centre back partner. No hole, no pass, no attack, no shot. A sideways pass. Another probe. Same result. That is but one example, of course, and by no means exhaustive.

This is perhaps why, along with financial and ethical reasons, the lower leagues are getting a bit more attention and are becoming more popular, relatively speaking. There is no Prozone there, you may have an idea that a particular player is handy and can do certain things well but perhaps not in any great detail, because you have only watched him a couple of times. This might be why you can see some cracking passes in the non-league. There are, for example, without intending to be unkind, some slightly overweight central midfielders who can barely move but stick the ball on their toe and you’ll witness a mesmeric 40 yard pass curled perfectly round the back of or through a defence and on to a speedy forward’s toe. OK, the striker might well then blast into row Z or scuff it to the keeper but you can’t have everything. It is, however, something, positive, not something destructive. Similarly you could see a winger who is unknown to the defender, they don’t know he’s better cutting inside so give him too much space. The defender might get wise to this but there is that element of surprise that wouldn’t be there if the winger had been reduced to a stat on a user friendly laptop screen.

Of course, it doesn’t always work, there is human error or good fortune but more often than not a stalemate or narrow, error-induced victory is the result. The by product of this is, of course, there are more very close calls and more delicate decisions a referee has to make and those mistakes are magnified because they stand out. If a game of football chess with this negative outlook and narrow window for error is what you like, fine, it’s not all bad, but I’d rather be entertained a bit more and not make a scapegoat out of the guy (ref or player) who committed the one error that decided a game.

This ill-conceived lunchtime rant is nearly over but let’s put the joy back into football and get rid of these stultifying devices. Or let’s all go and watch some non-league football and have a pie and a pint by the pitch. I know that’s technically not always allowed but you go and see if you can’t get away with it.
