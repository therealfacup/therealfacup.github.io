**Craven Cottage – Fulham v Swindon – FA Cup**

While Simon was away gadding about the nether regions of the world, Damon continued to keep it real by … errrr … starting the year at a Premier League Ground! Tsk! We usually want the underdog to win but, having no real connection to Swindon, this time we had half an eye on the underdog getting their noses rubbed in it. Swindon surprised us with some good footy and we changed our minds. Nice branded plastic pints in an SS style at [the Cottage](http://therealfacup.co.uk/2010/01/03/fulham-1-swindon-0/)!

**Alwyns Lane – Chertsey v Whitley Bay – FA Vase**

Back to reality and a ball gets blasted in to Tree Z. Our first proper foray into the FA Vase. Moneybags Chertsey couldn’t stretch to a special get-a-ball-out-of-a-tree-stick so someone resorted to using a thingamyjig. The natives sang songs about the north being a strange place, which upset Whitley Bay native Adele’s first non-league experience. It was tiresome after the first [twenty minutes](http://therealfacup.co.uk/2010/02/09/chertsey-town-1-whitley-bay-1/). **[![DSC01461.JPG](http://lh5.ggpht.com/_3L4_Y2OBz2M/S4CLJlBKSuI/AAAAAAAAB9M/vMJaE67iruw/s320/DSC01461.JPG)](http://lh5.ggpht.com/_3L4_Y2OBz2M/S4CLJlBKSuI/AAAAAAAAB9M/vMJaE67iruw/w800/DSC01461.JPG)**

**?????? – Ryman League**

Great PA Systems of our time – a realfacup badge to anyone who can name the ground we visited on this derby day in February? And if you can name the PA then do get in touch! It was a sunny/rainy/windy/warm/cold day in winter/spring/summer. I fell over in the club bar and tipped beverage all over the shop. Missed the start of the second half, not for the last time this year. No link this time, you’ll have to find it for yourself! Mind you, we went to the reverse fixture on New Year’s Day, like just now.

**Wembley – Cardiff v Blackpool – Championship Play Off Final**

A sea of orange as we watched a bigger-than-usual underdog steamroller their way in to the Premier League. We played this one in classic realfacup style by joining the Tangerines for a few pre-match liveners in the sun. Cracking game topped off by the unforgettable sight of 30,000 baffled fans struggled to come to terms with what had just happened and what the win meant. Top class day out. We didn’t bother with a report for some reason but previewed [here](http://therealfacup.co.uk/2010/05/20/saturdays-big-final/) and also see the Mysterious Tangerine’s [Postcard From The Premier League](http://therealfacup.co.uk/2010/09/07/postcards-from-the-premier-league-2/)

**Mill Road – Arundel v Hailsham – FA Cup**

Sussex lino legend and Father Jack lookalike, Paul John, gets much love from therealfacup and local footy clubs. On another cool but sunny but wet but warm and wasp-riddled day, non-league tactics were ramped up a notch with the deployment of a libero. Worked a treat as well as Arundel marched through.[ Lots of wasps](http://therealfacup.co.uk/2010/08/15/bzzz-off/).

**[![IMG_2725.JPG](http://lh6.ggpht.com/_3L4_Y2OBz2M/TE99ZhN0cKI/AAAAAAAACM8/nYW9Gc66xms/s320/IMG_2725.JPG)](http://lh6.ggpht.com/_3L4_Y2OBz2M/TE99ZhN0cKI/AAAAAAAACM8/nYW9Gc66xms/w800/IMG_2725.JPG)**

**Gander Green Lane – [Sutton v Staines](http://therealfacup.co.uk/2010/07/31/yellow-white/) – Pre-Season Friendly**

Match sponsor? Boys footy bible for posters, Match Magazine! St Johns ambulance, thrilled with Sutton v Staines. Is it just us or does one of them look like Matt Lucas?

**[![IMG_2766.JPG](http://lh4.ggpht.com/_3L4_Y2OBz2M/TGXanH9mXqI/AAAAAAAACPM/Zn2fPODHNVI/s320/IMG_2766.JPG)](http://lh4.ggpht.com/_3L4_Y2OBz2M/TGXanH9mXqI/AAAAAAAACPM/Zn2fPODHNVI/w800/IMG_2766.JPG)**

**Cobham – The Running Mare – Pre-FA Cup**

Ahh, the glory of metaphor. The rainbow signifies the proverbial pot of gold, of course. But what lies at the end of this rainbow? Why, it’s Chelsea’s Cobham training ground, of course. Perfect and poetic. Our destination? Just yards away at Mole Valley’s rudimentary but [homely ground](http://therealfacup.co.uk/2010/08/17/soggy-moles-fall-at-the-first/). Two worlds collide.

**[![DSC_0049.JPG](http://lh4.ggpht.com/_3L4_Y2OBz2M/THw2YgcJXNI/AAAAAAAACcY/wp23F7zrrbA/s320/DSC_0049.JPG)](http://lh4.ggpht.com/_3L4_Y2OBz2M/THw2YgcJXNI/AAAAAAAACcY/wp23F7zrrbA/w800/DSC_0049.JPG)**

**King George’s Field – [Corinthian-Casuals v Lingfield](http://therealfacup.co.uk/2010/08/31/the-joy-of-sixty/) – FA Cup**

Non League in a nut shell at Corinthian-Casuals. One man? Check. His dog? Check. Any paying customers? Errr … just about. As well as four realfacupsters there were 56 others. How on earth do Corinthian Casuals survive?

**[![IMG_3213.JPG](http://lh3.ggpht.com/_3L4_Y2OBz2M/TH2O3eNUJiI/AAAAAAAACd8/FwgMLDy8h2Y/s320/IMG_3213.JPG)](http://lh3.ggpht.com/_3L4_Y2OBz2M/TH2O3eNUJiI/AAAAAAAACd8/FwgMLDy8h2Y/w800/IMG_3213.JPG)  
Champion Hill – Dulwich Hamlet v Tonbridge – FA Cup.**

[The Wall](http://therealfacup.co.uk/2010/09/01/in-wall-we-trust/) lured Damon in at this game but it was a nervy affair for the Hamley faithful. Youth teamers tried to get in the photo. Beer by the touchline? I’ll have a cheeky pint please. Not the best afternoon for Dulwich.

 **[![IMG_3389.JPG](http://lh6.ggpht.com/_3L4_Y2OBz2M/TIgaRvBbcSI/AAAAAAAAChw/YeopqMjerY8/s320/IMG_3389.JPG)](http://lh6.ggpht.com/_3L4_Y2OBz2M/TIgaRvBbcSI/AAAAAAAAChw/YeopqMjerY8/w800/IMG_3389.JPG)**

**The Bank Pub – Sutton**

Ray Stubbs talks to inanimate objects. The FA Cup ponders a while. Errr, I don’t know where this is going. [The Actual FA Cup meets therealfacup](http://therealfacup.co.uk/2010/09/09/sutton-on-the-dock-of-the-bay/).

**[![IMG_3601.JPG](http://lh4.ggpht.com/_3L4_Y2OBz2M/TI0a_au5jzI/AAAAAAAAClM/DmhHFQDDptY/s320/IMG_3601.JPG)](http://lh4.ggpht.com/_3L4_Y2OBz2M/TI0a_au5jzI/AAAAAAAAClM/DmhHFQDDptY/w800/IMG_3601.JPG)

**Hayes Lane – [Cray Wanderers v South Park](http://therealfacup.co.uk/2010/09/14/last-ditch-laurent-sends-wanderers-through/) – FA Cup**

therealfacup gets the death stare from the Cray Wanderers bench.Eek! We were a little perturbed. But we’re still here and there was only a small fence separating us from certain death. And it were on’t telly!

**[![DSC_0038.JPG](http://lh6.ggpht.com/_3L4_Y2OBz2M/TJ-2s1NTUrI/AAAAAAAACns/PzhhL_YwLpE/s320/DSC_0038.JPG)](http://lh6.ggpht.com/_3L4_Y2OBz2M/TJ-2s1NTUrI/AAAAAAAACns/PzhhL_YwLpE/w800/DSC_0038.JPG)**

**Imperial Fields – Tooting &amp; Mitcham v Staines – FA Cup**

It’s not a great time to be a Tooting fan but … this chap takes isolation to new levels. Did he smell? Santa chilling out? Nice rolly up troozaz. Smashing.

**[![IMG_3687.JPG](http://lh4.ggpht.com/_3L4_Y2OBz2M/TKBJRCRv52I/AAAAAAAACrs/vWU0sv4uKYc/s320/IMG_3687.JPG)](http://lh4.ggpht.com/_3L4_Y2OBz2M/TKBJRCRv52I/AAAAAAAACrs/vWU0sv4uKYc/w800/IMG_3687.JPG)**

**Margate – Margate v Kingstonian – FA Cup**

Sunny Margate in September. This Kingstonian sub is messing with the head of a subbed team mate. Flick that window shut. Wait for it to be opened again. Flick window shut. Giggle.

**[![DSC_0029.JPG](http://lh6.ggpht.com/_3L4_Y2OBz2M/TKWwJsh2muI/AAAAAAAACuo/z_TMoPPQp8A/s320/DSC_0029.JPG)](http://lh6.ggpht.com/_3L4_Y2OBz2M/TKWwJsh2muI/AAAAAAAACuo/z_TMoPPQp8A/w800/DSC_0029.JPG)

**Kingsmeadow – Kingstonian v Margate – FA Cup Replay**

Oh my! Tubby keeper + Burger hut can only mean one thing. Unkind photo composition. Margate’s nearly-hero Jamie Turner needs a thought cloud round that. Jamie had a blinder. He took some good-natured stick off the K’s fans then couldn’t quite keep out the required [number of penalties](http://therealfacup.co.uk/2010/09/30/penalty-10-of-them/). Although his team mates could have helped by actually scoring some.

**Church Road – [Hayes &amp; Yeading v Wycombe](http://therealfacup.co.uk/2010/11/09/elderly-ainsworth-rescues-pragmatic-chairboys/) – FA Cup**

The thin lime green lime, I mean line. Hayes &amp; Yeading get a crowd for the first time this season. Wycombe Wanderers turn up mob handed and old bill shows force. **[![148124_485950297358_156412412358_7014350_1042432_n[1].jpg](http://lh3.ggpht.com/_3L4_Y2OBz2M/TNf9hngtAeI/AAAAAAAADMA/VU96887bsT4/s320/148124_485950297358_156412412358_7014350_1042432_n%5B1%5D.jpg)](http://lh3.ggpht.com/_3L4_Y2OBz2M/TNf9hngtAeI/AAAAAAAADMA/VU96887bsT4/w800/148124_485950297358_156412412358_7014350_1042432_n%5B1%5D.jpg)**

**Earlsmead – Harrow Boro v Chesterfield – FA Cup**

Television glamour comes to therealfacup. Red-ish carpet! Actually a plastic mat. Ken Charlery deserved better. We deserved access to the VIP lounge, as did our cohorts for the day from twofootedtackle and lastseatontheplane. Tish.

**Kingfield Stadium – Woking v Brighton – FA Cup Replay**

Ahhh, now there are memories. Flares on the pitch. Lighting up the foggy evening sky. Woking v Brighton. And little Mo Taricco gets his first run out in some years. And sets up a goal. And got sent off. Thoroughly entertaining fayre.

Gander Green Lane – Sutton v Wealdstone – Ryman League**
