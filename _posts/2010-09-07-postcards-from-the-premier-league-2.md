**A Preview (Part 2)**

Having looked at Pool’s prospects on the field a couple of weeks back, I’m rather chuffed with how my analysis has played out. Two good performances sandwiching a stuffing at the hands of one of the big four.

<object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0" height="385" width="640"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/ZL7RKBJy3DY?fs=1&hl=en_US"></param><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true"></param><embed allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" height="385" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/ZL7RKBJy3DY?fs=1&hl=en_US" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="640"></embed></object>

But in this belated second part of the preview, we look at goings on off the field and prospects for Blackpool FC retaining the spirit of the ‘FC’ and not becoming yet another ‘plc’. Already there have been some shenanigans, but the club appears to have maintained a good measure of continuity with its previous no frills approach to climbing the greasy pole. How long can this last though?

**A Sense of Proportion**

The battle to retain a sense of proportion and heritage appears to have been lost already to some within the Pool faithful who appear to have been seduced by the illusion of spunking money. A million here and a million there, fluttering like confetti from a limitless fountain of cash. The names of the likes of Owen, Boateng, Phillips and Bullard popping up in deadly earnest discussions on message board pages.

Who gives a shit if the other club has trebled the price, the wages are pushing £40k-a-week and the agent wants another 20% on top of that? WE’RE FILTHY STINKING RICH!!! … or maybe not.

Although the fabled £90m is a lot of money, when its gone, it’s gone. There exists no huge pool of die-hard fans to flood in to fill 25,000 seats at £30-a-pop week in week out, buy overpriced shirts or perhaps DJ Campbell themed condoms if we end up back in the Championship (or possibly worse).

The town of Blackpool is deprived (even [depraved](http://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/view/150831/Shameless-Scum-mum-s-lover-taunts-war-heroes/)) and the majority of its population transient, either working or staying in the ‘holiday capital of the north’. It is hemmed in on the coast and surrounded in the North West by several Premier League teams and dense population of league and non-league sides limiting the size of any catchment area. The lack of a sizable fan base, limits turnover, which in turn makes the club less of a prospect for sponsors or investors.

The unpalatable truth for many is that the windfall presents only an opportunity to secure the future of the club, not a guarantee. Blowing it on dreams of glory and prize money, acting the part of the ‘big Prem team’ has left football with a litany of lurid tales of debt and collapse. But how to resist such pressures? Surrounded by such profligacy at the top table, even among those clubs of more modest means, surely talk of principles, frugality and proper football will eventually give way to the pragmatism of cold hard cash.

**The Badger’s Arse Approach**

Fortunately, Blackpool have a ruling dynasty that has undergone an incredible metamorphosis in football chairman terms.

The elder Oyston, Owen, dreamt in the heady days of the mid-90’s of a 40,000 seat ‘Coliseum’ complete with a pitch on a hovercraft to move to the adjacent 10,000 seat reserve team stadium. He gambled heavily on promotion using the new TV riches dribbling down in the early Premier League years only to have his dreams shattered by non-other than Chris Kamara. His Bradford City side famously overturned a 2-0 deficit on their way to play off glory and brief and meteoric foray to the top table.

Worse was to come as Owen’s slightly illegal [dalliance](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/554522.stm) with an unwilling model put him out of action leaving the club in a period of interregnum under, of all people, his wife Vicky. But by the end of the 90’s, young Karl Oyston was in control and managed to move the club into safer financial waters, instituting badger-esque tight-arsedness: £90-a-week summer wages, an uncovered golf stand instead of a full stadium development and a general aversion to parting with cash. The subsequent collapse of ITV digital and the squeeze on the lower divisions did little to impact on Blackpool, with its Chairman firmly resolved to balance the books and keep them that way.

His achievement in taking the club from second bottom of the league to top of the Premier League, albeit for two hours, while incurring no debts speaks for itself. He also managed to bring on board a mysterious Latvian investor, millionaire Valerei Belokon, without compromising on his frugal principles. Any money invested has been channelled into the wage structure to build a squad rather than lavished on transfer fees and developments in the ground were linked firmly to success on the field.

**Oyston Out!**

Quite naturally, for his efforts and successes, many Blackpool fans utterly detest him. The refrain ‘Oyston Out’ is still, incredibly, uttered by some in spite of all that they have seen before their eyes. He is a seemingly cold, aloof individual who has never understood the value of PR. He is utterly indifferent to rumours of his ineptitude or miserliness being transformed into ‘fact’ by the fans’ rumour mill.

It is not possible to leap to the defence of Karl Oyston as a Machiavellian genius ruthlessly exploiting a position of weakness to his calculated advantage. No, Oyston Jr is a deeply flawed individual with a bad haircut. But incredibly he manages, although quite unwittingly, to fuse two characteristics that few football chairmen possess – the unwillingness to spend money and a continuation of his old man’s uncanny ability to preside over the selection of decent managers. The 20 year lineage of successful or soon to be successful managers, Ayre, Allardyce, Megson, Worthington, McMahon, Grayson, Parks and Holloway, was only broken by a brief spell with Colin Hendry at the helm.

Paradoxically, his pig-headedness when combined with a decent manager appears to work, channelling talent to achieve within firmly laid out boundaries. There has been no resort to spunking a transfer kitty on the panacea of big forward or a nippy winger. In 10 years, the Pool have registered barely a few million in fees, with Charlie Adam taking up a quarter of that. Karl’s loathing has meant that agents have also found Bloomfield Road a rather impossible place to ply their trade.

**Troubling Changes?**

With the season barely a few weeks old Karl Oyston sensationally [resigned](http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/b/blackpool/8925912.stm) the Chairmanship (thank god for the delay in writing part two of this preview). Rumours abound of divorce hearings and bankruptcy proceedings, the latter being an ironic fate for a man who navigated a football club through the toughest of financial tests whilst maintaining an even keel. Yet, it appears that Oyston Jr will remain at the helm in the new guise of CEO and the Oyston’s North Korean-style family rule also seems set to continue in the longer-term with rumours of another family member taking over the Chairmanship.

I feel that however this plays out it will depend to a large extent upon whether the club is maintained as what is essentially a family interest run by wealthy but ultimately small town businessmen. If this levee is broken, either by changes at the top or a radical change of Oyston heart, surely corporate interest will flood in.

But with this early season ‘uncertainty’ seemingly smoothed over, for now at least, how has the club coped thus far?

**Prospects**

The peril of a top heavy wage bill appears to have been averted with a £10,000-a-week pay cap. Strict adherence has frightened off the likes of Jon Stead, Robert Koren and Brett Pitman whose footballing desire couldn’t eclipse their greed as they all left the negotiating table for deals at Championship clubs. This all adds up to potential wage bill of around £14m-a-year. The scale of this can be grasped when you consider that Yaya Toure and David Silva alone cost City the best part of £20m-a-year in wages.

Quite strangely, in the transfer market I find it quite reassuring that Blackpool have had so many offers for players laughed at. Marlon Harewood, Ghana’s World Cup keeper [Richard Kingson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Kingson), Israeli international [Dekel Keinan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dekel_Keinan) and French U-21 [Malaury Martin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaury_Martin), have all arrived gratis with modest fees paid for youngsters [Elliot Grandin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliot_Grandin), [Chris Basham](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Basham), [Craig Cathcart](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Cathcart) and [Matt Phillips](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Phillips). The policy appears clear; pay for youngsters, try and pick up the experience on the cheap … or perhaps not.

The deadline day signing of perennial loanee [DJ Campbell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D._J._Campbell) for £1.3m seems to brook this policy. A fee of around £300,000 was agreed for his signature in January, but the deal fell through and lapsed into another loan. Lucky for Leicester, who have now pocketed four times that much for a player in his late 20s with no pedigree beyond his two successful loan spells at Blackpool in the Championship. Is this a case of pushing the boat out to secure the signature of a former player who proved his worth to Holloway’s system or is it worrying evidence of a creep into the land of silly money transfers? A cold January transfer window in the lower echelons of the table could prove a significant test of the Oyston’s resolve.

Commercially, the club has remained reasonably balanced. It has avoided the silliness of a full scale stadium development building a temporary stand in record time to boost capacity in the short term rather than have a brand spanking new stand that could only be ready in time for what promises to be a return to the Championship. It’s also heartening that the club has resisted the temptation to hike its prices, keeping the same price list for the third consecutive year.

The big challenge will come in restraining other interests within the Club. How long before the Latvian investment [begins to push](http://www.blackpoolgazette.co.uk/sports-news/Belokon-targets-Europe-with-Pool.6515010.jp) for an upping of the ante?

**How long can this last?**

In all honesty, I know not.

Ignoring the few dark clouds on the horizon then the picture remains rosy for the moment. Blackpool FC getting by, for the most part, as it always has done, albeit with four sides to the ground, more money in the bank and better players. Yet the simple equation of ‘money=success’ stalks abroad.

In the end the Premier League is like an overpriced ‘quality’ restaurant. Alluring to the uninitiated, but ultimately disappointing to those who’ve experienced it, save the moneyed few who couldn’t care about the price tag and wouldn’t have the first idea about what good fare was in any case. It is in dire need of some shaking up, and my preference would be for it to be led by teams practicing the enunciating the gospel of the Badger’s Arse, football over cash.

Blackpool are not the Christ-like redeemer of the sins of English football, but if they play their part in going over the top against the impregnable forces of the ‘Sports Entertainment business’ then all the drubbings and probable angst of relegation might not have been for nought.
