Today, The Real FA Cup is launching its official song!

It’s called “This Is A Football Song” and was written by a friend of ours many years ago.

You can find the lyrics and the original recording [here](http://therealfacup.co.uk/official-song/).

We are inviting anyone who is interested to record their own version of it and to send it to us at [admin@therealfacup.co.uk](<mailto: admin@therealfacup.co.uk>) – if we like it, we’ll publish it here (along with your name and website, if you so wish).

So get your guitar out and tune those vocal chords and maybe you could end up with your tune becoming the Official Version of the Official Song of The Real FA Cup!
