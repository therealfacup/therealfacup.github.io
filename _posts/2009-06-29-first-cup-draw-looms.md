The first F.A. Cup draw of the season takes place on Wednesday when the teams are drawn out of the hat for the Extra Preliminary Round of this yearâ€™s competition.

As soon as the draw is available, we will put the fixtures on therealfacup.co.uk and within a few days we will decide which of these fixtures we will be attending.

We will, of course, make an announcement of our plans on our news pages and via our regular newsletter so sign up now to be kept informed of our whereabouts come the start of the season!
