Cheers folks, 110 votes is the most we have had in one of our polls. Clearly, the vast majority were either Crawley or AFC Wimbledon fans which is, I guess, not entirely surprising as they have bigger followings than the vast majority of the other teams in the poll.

So, anyway, thanks again to all who voted and if your team lost and you’re going to the game, maybe you can write a report for us.

Otherwise, we shall be kicking the party off at around midday at a bar to be decided …
