With the replays out of the way and the Sevenoaks trophy cabinet extension not yet required this year, we have a look back at the round and what’s in store next. Not quite. There are still two outstanding ties:

**Willand Rovers v Falmouth &amp; Lymington Town v Hallen**

Willand got bogged down in simple bad weather and Hallen’s team bus got stuck in a jam after an accident in traffic on the way to the game.

There is one other outstanding issue that is altogether less savoury and not to do with the elements or misfortune. Holbrook Miner’s Welfare 1-0 victory over Belper Town was marred by shenanigans at stumps. At the final whistle a home ‘fan’ was said to have confronted a Belper player. The Belper coach intervened and was headbutted by the ‘fan’. The plot thickened when the Holbrook manager confirmed a reserve team player had been suspended pending investigation. Was this the perpetrator? Who knows but Holbrook will be nervous that they might not get to their 1st Qualifying Round match away at Rainworth.

When you consider how many times big matches go to penalties, it’s odd that only 4 did in the Preliminary Round. Faverham v Merstham was the pick, 2-2, 4-4 and then 5-4 on pens to the home side. Those four teams are unlikely to hold too many fears for their opponents in the next round. The ones that will be are 7-goal Enfield Town 1893 and Poole Town, along with 6 goal winners, FC Halifax, Bamber Bridge, VT and Gillingham Town.

Of the few teams we’ve seen so far, Enfield 1893 seem to be the team to watch. 12 goals in two games and Halstead have their work cut out in Q1. We’re tempted to go. Then again, we might fancy a bit of a crowd in this round and Dartford averaged over 1000 fans last season so they may take a few to Chipstead, who didn’t. The biggest crowd of the round could well be at Farnborough .v. Hastings. Not a local derby but both get pretty big crowds and it isn’t a long journey.

So, which of these are going to win therealfacup POLL in this round and will we have to travel further this time?
