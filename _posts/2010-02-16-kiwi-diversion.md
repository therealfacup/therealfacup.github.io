therealfacup is, quite literally, uprooting, lock stock and both smoking barrels of John Terry and Ashley Cole, to the other side of the world. For a few weeks. We’re definitely going to a game though. No doubt we’ll be basking in World Cup fever as the All Whites start getting jiggy with Jules. As we’re winging it, we’re not sure where we’ll be but it looks like either :

Canterbury .v. Otago on 28th Feb  
Hawkes Bay v Auckland on 14th March.

New Zealand Football Championship here we come!! We were hoping to bump into Paul Ifill along the way at Wellington Phoenix but they’ve desserted to the poncy A-League so who the hell knows, mate, cobber, sheila (that was because it’s the Australian league …. etc ) Boo.
