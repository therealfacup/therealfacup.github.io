As Moloko once said, the time is now. They also talked of absent minded friends, so to help you all remember here’s a handy guide to the locale and our intentions on Saturday.

The FA Cup football special, is about to depart. Of course, it isn’t because the usual litany of TfL horror awaits. The nearest rail hub to Wembley FC is, obviously, shut at the weekend so the nearest tube is Sudbury Town on the Piccadilly line.

From the station head down Station Approach to Bridgewater Road and then left and over the roundabout towards the Harrow Road/Watford Road junction. Take the Watford option and the club is just beyond Eton Avenue on the right hand side, so keep your eyes peeled. If you fancy a beer before hand we hope to be in the [Swan](http://www.beerintheevening.com/pubs/s/37/37271/Swan/Wembley), which is a few yards up Harrow Road. Should be there by about 1 before heading to the club bar at about 2.
