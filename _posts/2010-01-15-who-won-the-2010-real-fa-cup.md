Like Liverpool’s season, in our eyes the 2009/10 FA Cup is drawing to a close. The soulless big boys have now barged in to spoil the party and the pundits are slavering over an apparently corpse-like competition with few followers. That particular discussion is already as bloated as a big 4 trophy cabinet so we won’t go near it, except to say that we’ve been to more FA Cup games this season than the vast majority of hacks, pundits and myopic top flight fans and we’ve seen some cracking games in busier than normal grounds.

We’ve got our own ideas who should win but we want your suggestions too, we’ve been to lots of games but they are only a tiny fraction of games played. So, leave comments here, email us at the address on the home page or Tweet us your opinion, we’ve already had a couple of suggestions …

**Everton:** Tweeter grandoldteam argued that the Toffees should win it “Because of our run last season (Liverpool, Villa, Man Utd en route…) only to fall at the last hurdle.” While we all would have fancied that being the actual result, it is still last season. Sorry, no.

**Stoke City:** Ilkeston Town fan @ilson\_fan reasoned that the winners should be “Stoke. They beat York who beat Cambridge who beat the mighty Ilkeston so they must be REALLY good!” That is compelling but we can’t have a Premier Lge team winning The Real FA Cup.

So what do we want you to bear in mind, who has been the nicest, most helpful club, who’s had the best team, scored the best goals, embodied the FA Cup spirit, had the best sense of humour, perhaps it was where you simply had the best day out, maybe it’s the team who has played the most games or got the furthest from where they started, or perhaps you think your local team should win? Whichever of these is your reason, let us know and we’ll consider it.

Yes, we know that Forest Green are still in the Cup, we know there are some League 1 sides still in but they are going to have to go some to have the impact that some already have and, frankly, the mainstream coverage of the tournament is getting quite depressing. The Real has gone, hyperreal has arrived. Obviously, we’re looking to our non-league followers to step up to the plate here but our short list is:

**AFC Wimbledon | Aylesbury | Basildon Utd |Chelmsford City | Dartford | Lowestoft Town | Sutton Utd | Tooting &amp; Mitcham | Wealdstone |**

Who else should be on it – and why?
