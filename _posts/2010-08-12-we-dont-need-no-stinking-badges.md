COMPO!!!

In a week or so, when they turn up, these shameless promotional items (see stylish button badge below) will be despatched to the first ten correct answers (and a few will be delivered to some folk we even more shamelessly copied the idea off). It had to be done, we have 800 followers! No, we can’t believe that either, a couple of gobshites who over 800 people seem to listen to. Menkle.

To celebrate the first year of therealfacup and the start of the new 2010/11 FA Cup season, we have some invaluable collectors items to give away. The tricky little question is: Which teams do Simon and Damon actually claim to support? Answers in an email to [admin@therealfacup.co.uk ](mailto:admin@therealfacup.co.uk ) with your name and address. The first ten get a badge and the rest get signed up to a load of porn. Joking. We have no interest in your addresses, we’re electronic innit. We shall dispose of all entrants email in a responsible manner, &gt;TRASH&gt;EMPTY TRASH&gt;GONE. We shall not sell them on or bombard you with spam. If you want us to spam you, sign up for our newsletter! If you want porn, other internet sites are available.

Next up, expect a celebratory Real FA Cup version of Monopoly featuring all your favourite non-league grounds, obscure train stations, the emergency floodlight generator and the can-someone-smell-gas Board. Try to avoid the Go to Premier League square, it costs you your soul and you must save an Essex Senior League club in order to get out.

Adios. Happy answering.
