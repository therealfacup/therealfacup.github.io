**Sutton United 5 – 1 Dulwich Hamlet – FA Cup 2nd Qualifying Round 2011/12.**

Never, ever, in the time we’ve been doing this has there been a game where we didn’t have a beer before the game. There’s not been many where we haven’t had a beer at half time. There have been fairly few where we’ve not had a post-matcher. Today we managed to fail all three. A new record.

Simon was out all night dancing to young people’s music. As a result … well, that didn’t go too well, did it? The team that got us into all this got humped. Still can’t make up my mind if the scoreline was flattering, about right, or wildly conservative. In truth Sutton had a lot of chances, however, Dulwich also had some decent spells but lacked a quality final ball.

To be brutally honest, I could barely remember who I was … look at [Simon’s photos instead](https://picasaweb.google.com/realfacup/SuttonVDulwich).
