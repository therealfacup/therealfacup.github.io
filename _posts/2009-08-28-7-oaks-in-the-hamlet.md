</div>Thus spake the history book. There were oaks of seven at the London Road. Thy hearty oaks visit the Cotlif of the Dull Wych this very week ende. We shall gather in the Vale at around the time when the sun is highest and we shall view the joust while taking mead.  
  
OK. Kent Premier League outfit Sevenoaks Town visit Champion Hill to take on Ryman 1 South side Dulwich Hamlet. We shall try not to be partisan towards our local side. <div class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 170px">[![Hamlet](http://lh6.ggpht.com/_3L4_Y2OBz2M/SpZUe5Ec6QI/AAAAAAAAAL4/uowspVjw00I/Hamlet.jpg?imgmax=160)](http://lh6.ggpht.com/_3L4_Y2OBz2M/SpZUe5Ec6QI/AAAAAAAAAL4/uowspVjw00I/Hamlet.jpg?imgmax=640)Hamlet

</div>Hamlet have started the season off with a new manager, new players, new balls and maybe even new beer in the bar! Two draws and a defeat after a pretty decent pre-season campaign is perhaps less than was expected. Sevenoaks though have only managed a single draw so, all in all, not a great start in the league for either side. The Cup, should, therefore, provide a much needed filip for one of the teams. Directions to Champion Hill are simple and require little effort, take the train to East Dulwich from London Bridge. Trains depart every 15mins and it takes a mere 12 to get there. You’ll see the ground from the platform but if not, turn left out of the station and walk up the road towards Sainsbury’s. You should see the floodlights from the road so head across the small park or into Sainsbury’s main entrance. The entrance to teh ground is next to the carwash. The Vale pub is more or less opposite the station and shows football galore.

Noooooo!
