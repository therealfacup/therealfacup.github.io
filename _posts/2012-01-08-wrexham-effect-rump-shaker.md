Yeah

All I wanna do is zoom-zoom-zoom-zoom and a boom-boom  
Just shake your rump (x4)

Check, baby, check, baby, 1-2-3-4  
Check, baby, check, baby, 1-2-3  
Check, baby, check, baby, 1-2  
Check, baby, check, baby, 1

It’s called [rump shaker](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKReL_TbUtc&feature=fvst), the piece is like sweeter than candy  
I’m feelin’ manly and you say it’s comin’ in handy  
Slidin’ my claws from New York down by N. Virginia  
Ticklin’ you around Delaware before I enter  
Total seduction, from face, hips, to feet  
A wiggle and jiggle can make the night complete  
Now since you got the body of the year, come and get the award  
Here’s a hint, it’s like a long chop sword  
Flip town, so let me see you shake it up like dice  
The way you shake your rump is turnin’ mighty men to mice  
But A+ got a surprise that’s a back breaker  
Now let me see you shake your rump like a rump shaker

All I wanna do is zoom-zoom-zoom-zoom and a boom-boom  
Just shake your rump (x4)

Check, baby, check, baby, 1-2-3-4  
Check, baby, check, baby, 1-2-3  
Check, baby, check, baby, 1-2  
Check, baby, check, baby, 1

Wreckx-N-Effect is in effect, but I’m the wrecker  
Off the track, ’bout the honey shakin’ rumps and they backs in  
Booties of the cuties steady shakin’ but relaxin’  
The action is packed than a jam like the kinds of beat  
Bound to get you up, cold flowin’ like a faucet  
Not meant to make you sit, Not meant to make you jump  
But Jet make the hotties in the parties shake your rump  
I like the way you comb your hair, uh  
I like the stylish clothes you wear, uh  
It’s just the little things you do, uh  
That makes me wanna get with you, uh

All I wanna do is zoom-zoom-zoom-zoom and a boom-boom  
Just shake your rump (x4)

Shake it, shake it, shake it, now shake it  
She could spend every birthday butt naked  
Body and soul, makin’ me wanna squish her  
More just in the game a rumper like a sub-woofer  
Shake it to the left, shake it to the right  
I don’t mind stickin’ it to her every single night  
Come on pass the poom-poom, send it to papa  
Shake it, baby, shake it, baby, shake it, don’t stoppa  
Let me see you do the booty hock, and now I’ll make the booty stock  
Now drop and do the booty rock  
The way you’re shakin’ your grill’s really kill

But I ain’t into trickin’ just to treatin’  
And I ain’t into treatin’ every trick that I’m meetin’  
No, no, no, no, no, no, no  
Yeah, shake it, baby, shake it down, shake it like that

All I wanna do is zoom-zoom-zoom-zoom and a boom-boom  
Just shake your rump (x4)

Check, baby, check, baby, 1-2-3-4  
Check, baby, check, baby, 1-2-3  
Check, baby, check, baby, 1-2  
Check, baby, check, baby, 1-1 (x2)

Or, if you don’t like Wreckx n Effect’s “Rump Shaker”, you could read about the actual game on [theballisround](http://theballisround.co.uk/2012/01/08/500-reasons-to-love-football/)! Wrexham were, in fact, EXCELLENT value for the draw. Well done chaps.
