Now it’s getting serious, this was probably the biggest crowd we’d seen at Dulwich but even then the Dulwich fans generated precious little noise or atmosphere. As with most league games the away fans do still tend to be the most fanatic and noisy. Hendon’s fans were no exception and they bought World Cup semi-finalist and Ipswich Town cult figure Bontcho Guentchev!

Well, we think they did, we were fairly battered by halftime and it was such a brilliant sunny day leaning up against the wall behind the goal that we (well, I mean, I) completely forgot about him.

This game was the proverbial game-of-two-halves, the first a turgid affair only enlivened by a well volleyed Hendon goal and Dulwich being reduced to 10 men thanks apparently to a brutal hack that we didn’t really get a good view of. The second half, however, was excellent and entertaining. Dulwich, a man down and looking like it, conceded a second goal only a few minutes in but it was disallowed for an earlier foul. This seemed to drag Dulwich’s bloody carcass off the canvas, they enjoyed relentless possession for about 20 minutes and scored twice to take a previously unlikely 2-1 lead. The second goal was hilarious, during a melee a Hendon defender accidentally headed back towards his own goal and the keeper tipped it on to the bar, below which stood a forward. The game then went end to end for ten minutes before Dulwich made the classic error of sitting back and trying to hold on to their lead, which they classically failed to do. Well worth eight quid.

The only thing of note Simon mentioned about this game was the Marcus Stewart-esque spectacle of Dulwich’s star striker Laurent Hamici wearing gloves. It was 1st October and I challenge anyone to find an earlier example of wussery this season.
