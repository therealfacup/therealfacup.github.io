1\. Wealdstone .v. Rotherham (Sunday 8th Nov)  
2\. Millwall .v. AFC Wimbledon (Monday 9th Nov)  
3\. Cambridge Utd .v. Ilkeston (Saturday 7th Nov)

A HOOJ thanks to everyone who voted this week – and indeed in previous weeks – it was a hotly contested vote at the losers end but after a only a few days the winner was fairly clear.

Possibly the penultimate FA Cup action this year for us, if results go very badly for the little clubs. So, this is the biggest weekend of football of the whole season for therealfacup. But what a weekend, thanks to the wonders of television, the internet and public transport, there is a possibility of watching 7 games in 4 days.

That said, still a little surprised that so few voted for Millwall, perhaps their faintly paranoid shout of ‘no one likes us, we don’t care’ is wrong.

We put our poll up before the replays and before the TV games were announced so our main game and winner is actually on the Sunday, which means we could go to the silver and bronze medal winners as well!

Congrats to Wealdstone, we’ll hopefully be there on Saunday, tickets willing, and the same to Cambridge and Millwall.
