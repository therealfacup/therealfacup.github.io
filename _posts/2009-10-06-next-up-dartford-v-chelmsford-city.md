We gave you the chance to send us further afield and you adventurous folk well and truly took it, huh! Literally to the edge of London we must venture, towards a massive great bridge! Or tunnel, depending which way you’re travelling.

The visitors, Chelmsford, are a league, if not currently a class, above. Minor interest point sees former Ipswich and Hibs player Antonio Murray lining up for the Blue Square South side after failing to get (or perhaps turning down) a new contract with top flight new boys Histon.

Chelmsford’s emphatic result in the previous round was sandwiched between two league defeats that have cost the ambitious clarets quite dearly and they now find themselves languishing in mid table, well off the pace they kept up for so long last season.

The home team on the other hand can do no wrong. The last time Dartford failed to win a league game it was still August. They’ve won their last five and have 28 points out of a possible 30 overall, which means they top the league by some distance. In the close season, Dartford signed a a player we saw several times at Dulwich last year, Jamie Coyle, and former Gooner, Jamie Day, who left Highbury to join Bournemeouth and now finds himself sliding down the leagues.

This may not be quite the biggest name clash in this round of the FA Cup but it’s one of the most eagerly anticipated and it’ going to be one where a bit of an upset is possible. In fact I wouldn’t be surprised if the bookies have this one quite evenly poised.

35/40mins from London Bridge and the below link looks handily placed between station and ground …
