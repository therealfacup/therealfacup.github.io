OK, here’s a little update on the predictions we got prior to the big FA Cup kick off.

My prediction of “Dulwich to get to 1st Round proper and facing AFC Wimbledon. Loss.” is still on thanks to a 2-0 win over Eastbourne Town and 4-0 bashing of Horley. But, with an away game at Blue Square Bet South high flyers, Sutton United, on Saturday, this prediction maynot last much longer. We shall see.

[Jamie Cutteridge](http://twitter.com/#!/JamieCutteridge) didn’t fare quite so well, his prediction of “[@therealfacup](http://twitter.com/therealfacup) Ks will get to the first round without winning a game” proved only half right as K’s indeed failed to win a game. Their opponents, Poole, then failed to get disaqualified from the competition on account of not having done anything wrong. One down.

Caroline at the [Non League Show](http://twitter.com/#!/nonleagueshow/status/88533456581177344) – “[@therealfacup](http://twitter.com/therealfacup) asking what round your team will finish in this year.. I’m going Chelmsford to second round!” They’ve only just joined in of course and a home tie against fellow Blue Square Bet South side Tonbridge Angels won’t be a given, especially as Chelmsford have steadfastly refused to win a home game this season. Still not sure whether Caroline meant 2nd Round Proper or 2nd Qualifying Round though?

The second prediction to fall by the way side is from [Romford Reject](http://twitter.com/#!/RomfordReject) “@therealfacup Romford to reach 1st Round where they narrowly lose to Luton”. \*Ahem\* Southend Manor 4-2 Romford. Goodbye.

[Martin Jobling](http://twitter.com/#!/martinjobling)‘s prediction is still on “[@therealfacup](http://twitter.com/therealfacup) At least 2 Northern League clubs to knock out Evo-Stik teams. [\#FACup2011predictions](http://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23FACup2011predictions "#FACup2011predictions")“. Dunston UTS disposed of Durham City 4-0 in the last round while Whitley Bay narrowly lost to Kendal, 1-0. Spennymoor look to beat Ashton Utd to give Martin his win while Ashington and Bedlington Terriers are still in the tournament to keep the prediction alive.

[Secret Dolphin](http://twitter.com/#!/secretdolphin) “@therealfacup [@nonleagueshow](http://twitter.com/nonleagueshow) ever the optimist, Poole Town to go one better than last year, 1st Round Proper.” Well, it’s not over yet …
