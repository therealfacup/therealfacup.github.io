It’s not real, we were bored, and the purpose was to [bend the World’s oldest footy tournament into something different](http://therealfacup.co.uk/2012/07/11/the-fake-fa-cup/), more egalitarian and fun, while creatively interpreting the results in new ways. Mr Yapp hit the zeitgeist with his [FC Clacton v Southampton review](http://therealfacup.co.uk/2012/08/06/oh-when-the-saints-go-tumbling-out/), Andrew Harding kept it simple for [Wigan v Rocester with a single image](http://therealfacup.co.uk/2012/08/06/polka-dot-wigan-5-6-rocester/), Philippa went for the poetic angle of [sonnet for Selby v Leiston](http://therealfacup.co.uk/2012/08/05/robins-chirp-no-more/), Jamie Cutteridge went for [straight-to-video](http://therealfacup.co.uk/2012/08/05/worcester-1-7-wembley/) with news of disciplinary action, the Matlock fan enlisted some [youthful assistance](http://therealfacup.co.uk/2012/08/05/bolton-2-0-barking/) and leedeetee [digitally modelled Clapton](http://therealfacup.co.uk/2012/08/07/clapton-2-3-bristol-rovers/), while [putajumperon](http://therealfacup.co.uk/2012/08/05/kingdom-of-penney/), [Jimmy Driver](http://therealfacup.co.uk/2012/08/06/sea-goal/) and [Dr Billyo](http://therealfacup.co.uk/2012/08/05/summer-holidays/) went for the traditional but fantastical approach to match reporting.

There were a few ties undecided and our South London brethren The Pigeon Standers [played god](http://therealfacup.co.uk/2012/08/06/the-jokers/) and resolved the ties that the cards could not … and how they did it! You want a race down a bathroom wall? You got it! You want some B-ball? Uh huh. You want to see a man dressed as Uncle Sam choose a number between 1 and 13? Head here.

For the full list of results, head over [here](http://therealfacup.co.uk/2012/08/04/preliminary-round-results/). The replays will happen shortly and, should there be thirst for more, we’ll be trawling out the draw for Round 1 next month and you can come up with more new and intriguing ways to tell the world about the result.

A huge thanks to all the participants for their contribution, this has been an interesting and wonderful aside to our usual FA Cup action.
