The first proper Real World Cup podcast has hit the streets and iTunes!! Episode 1 features the hosts and debatable underdogs, South Africa, Media Watch – BBC .v. ITV, ‘Hit Wood’ and Call My Fact.

This week’s gobshites are Taylor, Bruno, Cockles and Damon and we get down with fruity sound of the vuvuzela. Actually, that’s a slight lie, it was a Croatia flavoured sub-vuvu acquired at a non-league FA Ciup tie.

Important questions are asked, will Gabriel Clarke and Gabby Logan get cosy while following the England team around South Africa. What has happened to El Tel and how long will Jurgen Klinsman wait before putting the boot into England?

And will Steve Rider ever get a new job?

If you have any questions or comments or come cross any examples of shabby World Cup media coverage, let us know by email, via the Twitter feed or via therealfacup Facebook wall.

Next week all of this and focus on North Korea, before they are officially knocked out. The week after it will be New Zealand, who will hopefully still be in, and we’ll be joined in the ‘studio’ by rabid Kiwi, Jiff.
