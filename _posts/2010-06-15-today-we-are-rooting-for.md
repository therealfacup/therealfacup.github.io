TOMMY.

And NEW ZEALAND. And here’s to hoping that Gary Lineker, Alan Shearer and Alan Hansen will have their sarcastic comments rammed forcibly where it’s cloudy. Although why Hansen feels so able to comment given his team aren’t there, we don;t know. Unless, of course, he is now a nationalised Englishman?

And North Korea, although they stand next to no chance, presumably.
