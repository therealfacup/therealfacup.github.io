**Goal Line Technology &amp; How Sepp Blatter Is Keeping The Football Family Together**

While everyone and all of their dogs were watching the dying embers of The Real FA Cup, we were in Sutton getting back to Ryman business.

Over the last few years we’ve become a bit partial to Ryman action, most of the teams are enjoyable to watch and there are usually enough fans to generate a bit of atmosphere. 570 today! And you rarely pay more than a tenner. The Premier Ryman is often as good a footballing VFM as you’ll get in England but the modernists and football elitists want to drive a stake between this level and the European Money Leagues.

We’ve mentioned elsewhere how goal line technology is unnecessary. This is not necessarily because of any misty-eyed longing to keep the game as it is but, simply, because so few game-changing decisions warrant this draconian technology. There are only a handful of games per season where this tech would lead to a fairer result – and fewer where it would affect the outcome of a tournament. In the grand scheme of things, bad offside decisions, dodgy penalties and sendings off change games unfairly more frequently but yet no one seems to want to sort them out with video technology.

However, any new form of technology is only ever going to be applied to the games that have TV cameras present and, even then, there would need to be an extra two at least. But there is already a technology gap between the leagues at top and further down and that doesn’t need widening because it could easily create two tiers of football, rather than a pyramidal system.

The technology gap we’re talking about refers to electronic scoreboards. Huh? How is that a problem, I hear you cry? Well, this is why …

Despite the three goals, the first half of this game was engaging without being particularly entertaining. Sutton had the vast majority of possession but didn’t create much, which was partly down to the paucity of final ball but mostly down to some staunch defending.

Arsene Wenger would have accused Wealdstone of playing anti-football and, while on one level it is an annoying way to set about a game of football, you can’t really criticise a mid-table team at least starting out in this manner when away at the league leaders. It doesn’t provide much entertainment though.

The Stones grew in confidence while Sutton’s desperation to get more men forward was leaving gaps that went unpunished thanks to a few unnecessary offsides. This new Stones adventure, ironically, led to the game saving goal at the other end that meant the second half would be more of a game. A looping header from Forbes on 44 minutes pleasingly slipped in off the underside of the bar.

HT – Sutton United 1 Wealdstone 2

Having already crammed in two pre-journey pints and one pre-match pint, we decided to cram in one half time pint. We did so unsuccessfully and missed the first few minutes of the second half. And here is where it all went horribly and amusingly wrong and amateurish thanks to the lack of technology. We could pretend this didn’t happen but why the hell should we? We aren’t the BBC.

The second half continued in the same vein and with an hour gone James Hammond diverted a harmless cross back towards his own goal to where he must have thought his keeper was. He wasn’t and the ball trundled into the corner. 2-2 and Wealdstone were now in a spot of bother.

Wealdstone were now defending for their lives trying to hold on to the point but were keeping Sutton’s waves at bay. Sutton’s forays were getting closer and closer as they committed more players and they almost paid when, over-committed, gave the ball to Spendlove who broke clear, drew the keeper and opted for the chip that appeared to be goal-bound before it just bounced past the post. That would have been game over.

Sutton’s now hopeful punts and long shots were going out for goal kicks but as injury time neared their accuracy increased and they were rewarded with a corner. It looked like Stones would hold out, they were defending well and were getting the luck. The corner was cleared and the second cross was headed on to the post by Dundas but when it looked like they’d escaped again Downer turned in the rebound to send the Sutton fans mad.

The players seemed to go unusually bonkers for what was a sealer rather than a winner but we left them to it and went to get to the front of the beer queue.

Having sat around chatting and watching Jeff for 10 minutes we overheard someone referring to the fantastic 4-3 win. We frowned a little and assumed he was referring to some other game somewhere. It turns out he wasn’t. With the slight delay in getting back out we’d missed the goal of the game, a 47th minute rasper from Spendlove after cutting in from the left.

So, the game was actually 4-3, not 4-2 and all of a sudden things started to make sense. The ten minutes we spent talking to a less than enthusiastic Sutton fan could be explained by the fact that it wasn’t a tense 1-2 but a rather less hopeful 1-3. The celebration being greater for the last minute last goal than for the penultimate goal was explained by the fact that it was not the 4-2 sealer but the 4-3 winner!

Incidentally, we also missed the shenanigans at the celebration of that goal. Apparently, the Sutton players went mad and allegedly goaded the Stones fans.

However, had Sutton had access to some modern technology in the form of an electronic scoreboard, these misunderstandings would never have happened. Before FIFA start pfaffing around with goal line technology, or even offside/sending off/penalty technology, they need to spend some of the GAZILLIONS of $$$$$ they made from the World Cup in supplying all league affiliated clubs with an electronic scoreboard so that the lazy amateurs like us don’t get stuff wrong. Thankfully, the brilliant visionary that is Sepp Blatter is railing against this technology that will create a further divide between the haves and heave nots.

&lt;sarcasm:off&gt;

There may be a story to be had on the amount of added time the ref stuck on in order for the final goal to be scored. Maybe he added 3 extra minutes because we missed 3? \[smile\] Some comments were made on Twitter by a few Stones players but they were deleted before we saw and we only heard stuff second or third hand at the end of the game. So don’t ask us to expand on it because we don’t know – and we’re not just fence sitting. It is fair to say Sutton players were ‘chuffed’ at the end but they perhaps deserved their final two goals as little as the Stones deserved their first two. Both situations were football muggings.

Aside from that, Wealdstone’s gaffer being accidentally pole-axed by a sliding tackle and Jenny The Giraffe getting busy with some fans were highlights of a decent enough game but one that didn’t quite take off as much as the scoreline would suggest. Although given we missed the good bits, maybe others thought it did!

At the end of the game we Tweeted “We thought it was 4-2, apparently we missed a goal, 4-3 to Sutton.” We got some stick for amateurism and here are a selection of the printable responses our error generated:

Massive thanks as ever to Gerard at Sutton, helpful chappy.
