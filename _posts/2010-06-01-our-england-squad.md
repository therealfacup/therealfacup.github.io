James, Hart, Green.

Johnson, Carragher – Ferdinand, Terry, King, Upson – A.Cole, Baines

Walcott, Lennon – Barry, Lampard, Parker, Milner – Gerrard, Cole

Heskey, Rooney, Crouch, Defoe

Missing out – Bent, Johnson, Carrick, Dawson, Warnock, Wright -Phillips, Huddlestone.

Well, this is kind of a mixture between what we want and what we expect, largely because several players we would have chosen weren’t even in the 30. Our two qualms with Fabio is he seems to have hit the panic button with the Scholes and Carragher situations. And, having spent two years saying he favours players playing regularly and in-form, he chooses Carragher, Walcott, Heskey, Crouch and Defoe, leaving out players with significantly better form. And we suspect he’ll take Carrick too.

UPDATE  
Baines, Dawson, Huddlestone Parker, A Johnson, Walcott, Bent miss out so we got three wrong.

ACTUAL SQUAD

James, Hart, Green.

Johnson, Carragher – Ferdinand, Terry, King, Upson – A.Cole, Warnock

Wright-Phillips, Lennon – Barry, Lampard, Carrick, Milner – Gerrard, Cole

Heskey, Rooney, Crouch, Defoe
