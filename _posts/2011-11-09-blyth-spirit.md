Here’s a little treat thanks to Spartans fan [Ross Teasdale](https://twitter.com/#%21/rosst99). With due respect to Mr Ian Brown, a Dublin DJ has added commentary from Blyth’s 1978 FA Cup Run and the Spartans fans to give … F.E.A.R a new lease of life.

Ross: “It brings a tear to the eye and the hairs on the back of your neck stand on end, even with me and my mates who weren’t even born at the time! It’s the first song on my FA Cup megamix CD which is played over the speakers at Croft Park. We gave it to the Management to put it on in the dressing room in the previous Round”.
