This season’s Real FA Cup is nearly over. The finger tips of the last non-league side have slipped from round 3’s bottom rung. We’ll keep an eye open but that is more or less it for us this season in the FA Cup and we’ll be ambling off into the sunset of the FA Trophy and Vase. The Golden Globes have passed, the small matter of the Oscars is due up soon but the BIGGEST event of the year is just about to get underway.
