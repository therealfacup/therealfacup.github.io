Oxhey Jets 1 Dulwich Hamlet 5  
Attendance 148  
Price £5  
Oxhey is near Watford and their ‘ground’ is in a new-build estate perched on a Hertfordshire hilltop with a great view over London. Bright sun, a fiver to get in and one or two gap-toothed yokels added to the allure – apologies to Oxhey fans but THERE really was.

After the relative luxury of Dulwich’s newish main stand, bar and appropriate seating, Oxhey’s ground was back to basics, understandably as they’ve only existed for about 25 years and have risen commendably through the real basement of football’s pyramid. The ground has two or three small sheds with some seats inside, I say ‘some’ because, like the teeth, many of them were missing.

This was a good game mind, not quite as one sided as the score would suggest even though Oxhey’s only goal was another embarrassing Dulwich cock up. Dulwich’s 3rd goal was the pick, a brilliant crossfield ball to the edge of the Oxhey box was headed deftly back across goal to the feet of a forward who took a touch and rifled it into the corner. It was a really engaging and competent game and we were so close to the pitch we could hear everything. Of course, all you non-league fans know this but for us fans of bigger clubs this is a welcome novelty. The highlight of the game was after an exchange between the ref and the Oxhey captain. As the captain walked away from his talking to, no cards issued, one of his teammates asked him what was said. “The refs a fucking idiot” came the reply. Back out came the whistle, swiftly followed by a yellow card. Magic.
