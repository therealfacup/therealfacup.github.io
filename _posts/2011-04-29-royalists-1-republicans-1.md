What better way to ‘watch’ the Royal Wedding than through therealfacup’s Twitter feed, including the great and good of football writers, bloggers, referees, players and official football club feeds. Ahhhh, doesn’t she look lovely?

The Royalists were out in force early doors. Referee [@gerrypimm](http://twitter.com/#!/gerrypimm) complimented the royal couple-to-be on their early start “the anti lot will still be in bed”. On the other side of the coin, Mansfield Town keeper Alan Marriott [@Mazza\_78](http://twitter.com/#!/Mazza_78) blessed his employers for having training so he didn’t have to “listen to them interview the bloke who did Diana’s dress 30 years ago again!!” BBC Footy’s [@danwalkerbbc](http://twitter.com/#!/danwalkerbbc) took the \*ahem\* middle ground with “Today is the day that Adolf Hitler married Eva Braun in his bunker. Interesting. [\#royalwedding](http://twitter.com/#%21/search?q=%23royalwedding "#royalwedding")”

Lord Rio Of Peckham [@rioferdy5](http://twitter.com/#!/rioferdy5) quipped “If Kate had gone Primark and purchased her dress from there she would have become ‘the peoples Princess’ instantly! [\#justsaying](http://twitter.com/#%21/search?q=%23justsaying "#justsaying")” while former Ipswich defender [@GaryCroft1974](http://twitter.com/#!/GaryCroft1974) was “Surprisingly getting hooked on [\#williamandkate](http://twitter.com/#%21/search?q=%23williamandkate "#williamandkate") on tv already! Help me!!” was more reverential. Former Palace midfielder [@GeoffThomasGTF](http://twitter.com/#!/GeoffThomasGTF) wished “Good luck to Kate and Wills today. Amazing scenes already in London. BBC doing a great job” and noted how he was “Very lucky to have met Prince William in 2006 in German at the World Cup. Had a chat about cycling as well as the footy.” I wonder what he said about the hun? Oh, right, yeah, I see …

England player [@KarenJCarney](http://twitter.com/#!/karenjcarney) was equally as excited, if not as grammatically astute “Royal wedding I’m well exciting!! Hope everyone else is :-)?????” and even Johnny Forriner was lovin’ it. Stoke’s Asmir Begovic [@asmir1](http://twitter.com/#!/asmir1) “Morning! Rise and Grind. Royal Wedding today, best of luck to Will and Kate” while the emotion got to former Chelsea and Brum striker [@MikaelForssell](http://twitter.com/#!/MikaelForssell) “snifff…I think I got something in my eye…sob…” So, yah boo sucks to resident 200% doodler [@Dotmund](http://twitter.com/#!/Dotmund) who weighed in with a classic literary quote “ROYAL WEDDING DAY!!!!! How proud I am to be English! Foreigners must be as sick as pigs! (Adrian Mole, 29th July 1981)”.

The journos then started to pile in. The Guardian &amp; Independent’s footy hacks veered between sniffy and indifferent. [@Georgina\_Turner](http://twitter.com/#!/Georgina_Turner) “I’m not watching the Royal wedding, but according to Twitter David Beckham has just arrived dressed as an orgasm.” and [@NickSzczepanik](http://twitter.com/#!/NickSzczepanik) bemoaned “I can’t believe the BBC has cancelled today’s Homes Under The Hammer for a celebrity wedding …”. But not as treasonous as [@CaulkinTheTimes](http://twitter.com/#!/CaulkinTheTimes) who simply said “Word of the day: guillotine.” and [@acjimbo](http://twitter.com/#!/acjimbo) “re royal wedding: once everyone’s inside, can we just lock the doors and take the country back?” Heh, both made us chuckle anyway. The Beeb’s Dan Walker produced a handy chart “[\#royalwedding](http://twitter.com/#%21/search?q=%23royalwedding "#royalwedding") interest chart: 1 Apathy. 2 Indifference. 3 Glance. 4 TV on. 5 Friends round. 6 Scone baking. 7 Bunting. 8 Hysteria Where r u?” Mr Caulkin was on ‘0’.

This prompted some action from the footy clubs, [@Gornal\_AFC](http://twitter.com/#!/Gornal_AFC)‘s official feed responded “@danwalkerbbc 1-2 up to 3 for a sporting celeb then back to 1”. Ipswich Town blogger [@CherryHintonBlu](http://twitter.com/#!/CherryHintonBlu) reported on the reporting “Eamonn Holmes: “(Tara Palmer-Tompkinson) has just has surgery on her nose, which I must say is looking very pretty”. Genius.” while celebrity Town Tweeter (yes, you are, Gavin) [@gavinbarber](http://twitter.com/#!/gavinbarber) noted “According to UEFA regulations, Kate Middleton’s dress may contain a maximum of three sponsors’ logos [\#royalwedding](http://twitter.com/#%21/search?q=%23royalwedding "#royalwedding")”

@[darrenbyfield](http://twitter.com/#!/darrenbyfield) did nothing for the image of footballers with “How great wud it be if the queen just gave the crowd the wanker sign hahaha” and Arundel striker [@mattaxell](http://twitter.com/#!/mattaxell) echoed the nation’s male view “Will’s punching way above his weight to be fair [\#royalwedding](http://twitter.com/#%21/search?q=%23royalwedding "#royalwedding")“.

And then the singing started …

Blogger and writer [@iainmacintosh](http://twitter.com/#!/iainmacintosh) chimed in with “Christ, imagine being stood next to Elton John for the singing bits. You’d be livid.” and “I bet Victoria Beckham’s just miming and doing that pout she does.” On the Posh front, former Brizzle winger [@Scotty\_Murray](http://twitter.com/#!/Scotty_Murray) came up with an idea “They should get sky sports just to put a player cam on posh and becks that would be more fun” but Soccer AM’s [@HellsBellsy](http://twitter.com/#!/HellsBellsy) wasn’t so impressed with the tunes “I’m not having that much singing at my wedding.” but perhaps inadvertently noted imminent wedding bells?? Watford podcaster [@rookerymike](http://twitter.com/#!/rookerymike) got into the footy spirit with “10 bonus points to anyone in Westminster Abbey currently singing ‘Feed the goat and he will score…'”. Indeed.

The aforementioned Mr Pimm was prolific in his pro-Royal/Wedding tweetage and we pondered whether refs loved the discipline of a wedding. We asked Gerry, “@[therealfacup](http://twitter.com/therealfacup): the queen has about the same level of influence as fergie!” was the response. Red card.

What a splendid day? Final word to [@BrentwoodTownFC](http://twitter.com/#!/BrentwoodTownFC) “Congrats Will &amp; Kate let the Nation now celebrate, not too much stay fresh for our last home league game tomorrow v Wingate&amp;Finchley KO 3PM”
