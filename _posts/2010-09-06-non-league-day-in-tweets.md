So, while I was at a wedding in Wales, [Non League Day](http://www.nonleagueday.co.uk/) went ahead without me, how very dare they. Simon kept therealfacup’s hand in by going beyond the call of duty and cycling 40 miles from South London to Canvey Island to follow Tooting &amp; Mitcham United and, across the country, plenty of folk did similar, without the cycling bit.

Another of our local sides, Sutton, boasted a bumper crowd 200 up on the average, Fisher Athletic’s crowd was [up 60%](http://twitter.com/Fisher_Ben/status/23072913362), Wealdstone’s up 25% and zeitgeist club Lewes netted their [2nd highest turn out in the last year](http://twitter.com/Lewes_cfc/status/22984210328). A few clubs reported dwindling crowds or no change but, hey, not everyone can win!

As ever, Twitter hummed with excitement about Non League Day, it started trending in a number of locales around England. Just stick ‘nonleagueday’ into the search and read all hundreds if not thousands of tweets all bigging up the day, giving goal action, quirks and photos from the games and, afterwards, links to match reports.

Some choice favourites of mine express why Non League Day was and should always have been a success. @monfter got to the crux of it, “Enjoyed my #nonleagueday at Maine Road v Ramsbottom. £10 for entry, prog, pie &amp; drink. I’ll be back for game v New Mills. @non\_league\_day” [@DolphinHotel](http://twitter.com/DolphinHotel/status/23042089350) captured the very real comments of players leaving the field “@non\_league\_day Birtley Town player at #nonleagueday: “It’s the first time in Birtley’s history we’ve had any fans.””

Benevolent Scotland fans, waiting for connecting flights back home after returning to Gatwick from Lithuania, got into the spirit and popped over the road from the airport to catch Crawley .v. Fleetwood. On a similar tack, @LesRosbifs “Got sick of traffic on North Circular and M25, so peeled off and caught Egham Town 3 Epsom &amp; Ewell 1. Enjoyable for me &amp; kids. #nonleagueday”. Opportunist.

Then there were the jealous few who too late realised they’d missed out on something, [@hyllandinho](http://twitter.com/hyllandinho/status/22990214967) said “Wish I’d got involved in @non\_league\_day #nonleagueday; bike ride was good but I like these initiatives! Will look for some Sunday fixtures”

The attitude to Non League Day by all and sundry cannot be underestimated, so much positive energy coming from those thoroughly behind the initiative and from those who were turned on to lower league football. From the off, the excellent BBC [@nonleagueshow](http://twitter.com/nonleagueshow) got right behind it. Football legends [200%](http://www.twohundredpercent.net/) gave us all the low down and, on the day, [@itvfootball](http://twitter.com/itvfootball)‘s [@jamesappell](http://twitter.com/jamesappell) made sure they RT’d scores and kept people in the loop. John Terry apparently showed up at Eastbourne and [Jonathan Pearce turned up at Lewes](http://twitter.com/DannyLast/status/23046098899), well, who hasn’t turned up at the Dripping Pan recently? Except us.

Of course, Non League Day wouldn’t be a non league day without one condescending supporter of a big club. With apparent lack of irony and self awareness, [@ManUtd24](http://twitter.com/ManUtd24/status/22988756340) shows the world exactly what sort of fans the big clubs have\* “Inform me of the FC United score today, guys. Trying to look like I care…#nonleagueday” Charming and nothing less than we’d expect.

A big thanks to James Doe [@non\_league\_day](http://twitter.com/nonleaguedayuk) for giving the country his idea and to everyone for getting behind it. When’s the next one? And thanks to the Tweeters mentioned above for making sure I could look back in anguish.

\*A sweeping and unjustified conclusion based on one Tweet. Well, it served a purpose. Apols to @ManUtd24 if his/her sarcasm has been missed.
