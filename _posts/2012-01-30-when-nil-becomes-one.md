All good things must come to an end.

Until a fortnight ago, Dulwich had scored in every one of their home league games this season.

Until Saturday, Dulwich had not been beaten at home in the league.

In an effort to increase the quality of the photographs available on this website and to try and avoid too many entries on Crap Photos of Non-League, my other half bought me a better camera for Christmas. In all the years of doing this blog, I’m yet to get a passable photo of a goal actually happening so my hopes were high as I trundled along to Champion Hill to see them take on fellow high-fliers Bognor in a top-of-the-table Super Saturday clash earlier this month. The game finished 0-0.[![](http://lh6.ggpht.com/-Nm-CahuP9U8/TyWnupZClvI/AAAAAAAABfY/YC8YcigA1X4/h320/DSC_0748.jpg)](http://lh6.ggpht.com/-Nm-CahuP9U8/TyWnupZClvI/AAAAAAAABfY/YC8YcigA1X4/w800/DSC_0748.jpg)

It was the first time Dulwich had played out a 0-0 draw at home for around 3 years so you’ll forgive me for feeling at least a little responsible.

I’m not a man of superstition though (I am) so there’s no way they’d fail to score two games in a row, especially when faced with mid-table mediocrity in the form of Godalming Town.

2.45pm. That was the time at which I left my house to get to the game. I love non league football.

Initial signs were good – Dulwich were playing their usual brand of free-flowing, passing football and chances were coming at nice, neat, regular intervals. New camera at the ready, it was surely only a matter of time? The Godalming goalkeeper had other ideas though. None shall pass.

At half time, I devoured Bovril. I love Bovril. I also moved to the other end of the ground and decided to take up a position in the stands for a bit of elevation on the shot of the eventual goal for the home side. Dulwich had other ideas.

Midway through the second half, Godalming broke away and scored. I missed it. I was at the other end.

Dulwich had no other ideas. They’d tried everything. Oh, there was huffing. There was even a bit of puffing. But houses were not in the mood for being blown down. And they lost. 0-1.

It can’t be me, can it? It can’t be.

I’ll be back.
