Our first independent report in a few weeks and this poetic missive comes from a neutral local, Paul, who went to the Wealdstone v Rotherham game. Looks like his initial experience wasn’t too sharp but by the end maybe the Stones have a new fan? We should add that these are not the views of therealfacup – our report up shortly.

> **An FA Cup journey began at a Wetherspoons in a positive manner.  
> 4 pints for a fiver is not to be sniffed at.  
> A slightly simple looking Rotherham fan chatted.  
> Initial fears of violence were soon dispelled.  
> A quiet suburban Ruislip afternoon was destroyed by a car alarm and a host of chanting.  
> On the walk, a turning missed and a kick off missed.  
> On arrival the ground was a shed.  
> The ticket overpriced.  
> The view terrible.  
> The toilets warm.  
> A walk of 3 sides of the ground yielded a small hole at a fence to see ¾ of a pitch.  
> The first goal was missed behind a head and possibly due to a lack of attention.  
> The spectator was thinking – what’s all the fuss about this FA cup lark.  
> The 2nd goal a goodun. Some bald guy tonked it in past the afro-ed peach keeper.  
> The onion bag bulged.  
> On half time the crowd moved  
> A view was gained  
> An average day became far better in the 2nd half.  
> A small hillock was found.  
> The Grassy Knoll of Football.  
> A quality underdog goal.  
> Some breakaway league team luck.  
> A solid spirited fight back from the local builders and token postman.  
> Another quality goal. 3-2…  
> More chances.  
> A spectator was happy.  
> A Romance? Not sure – but certainly a start.  
> Come on you Stones!**
