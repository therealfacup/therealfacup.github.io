We are all now polishing off our summer footballing aperitif, so it must be time for the starter course of the Extra Preliminary Round of the FA Cup. Woohoo. Back to our bread and butter of the real FA Cup, you’ll all be pleased to know, although we may yet have one last dip at a World Cup podcast.

The fixtures are out and the teams we followed last year all return to give it another shot. FA Vase holders and one of therealfacup favourites, Whitley Bay, kick off their tournament with a trip to West Yorkshire where they have distinct pyramid advantage over Liversedge. Their vanquished Norfolkian opponents at Wembley, Wroxham, face a tricky trip to Northamptonshire to meet Rothwell Corinthians.

A lot of the teams we saw at the back end of the season don’t join in for a wee while yet but there are few who have to kick off at the harsh start. Locally unpopular moneybags, Chertsey, will be tested by new Combined Counties peers Mole Valley SCR, about whom we know nothing. Yet. Valley boys Merthyr face a hefty schlep from South Wales down to Devon to face Willand Rovers and Sussex’s East Grinstead Town host a bunch of chaps called Holyport from the Hellenic League who are based in Maidenhead.

They of the pitch you can see from everywhere, Sevenoaks Town, travel round the M25 to visit Lingfield while Broxbourne make a similar trip round the northside of the orbital to pretty home counties stalwarts St Albans. Broxbourne’s nemesis in one of last season’s realfacup classic goal-fests, Enfield 1893, go west past the Ivinghoe Beacon to get to Tring.

It would be rude not to mention the place every team wants to get to at the end of all this, of course, and Wembley travel out to Essex to face the felllows from that most perennial start of bus-replacement services, Witham. Basildon beat Wembley last year and they head into London to face Essex Senior League champions Bethnal Green United. But we can’t really justify visiting any of these teams again so soon, can we?

So, where will we go first this year? Well, I (Damon) fancy a country-ish setting that isn’t a ludicrous distance from London but it remains to be seen whether Simon does and whether we do a vote like we have done in the past, we haven’t decided yet.

I quite like the idea of Dorking v Bracknell Town. Some nice boozers nearby and a little wine thing called Denbies for the ladies. [Arundel FC](http://twitter.com/ArundelFC) assure us that their gaff is picturesque at this time of year, and it looks it, which is enticing. Our chums at [The Ball Is Round](http://theballisround.co.uk/) appear to agree.

Closer to home, there’s Cockfosters v Hullbridge Sports. Leafy? Tick. On the tube? Tick. Lazy? Tick. No, it’s too close. Ditto Greenwich Borough, although they are playing Cartman and Kenny et al from South Park so the match report could be puntastic, much like Cockfosters in fact. Are the hosts firm favourites? Hard match? Limp performance … endless cliched and childish amusement. Sorry.

Hmmm … what to do. Maybe we should leave it until after the World Cup Final to decide. Or maybe y’all can suggest where me might alight? FACTS, people, give us reasons why we should go where!
